What does distinguish them from many of the young go-getters \\nthe company takes on each year is that neither man is particularly filled \\nwith ambition. Neither has any kind of career plan or any specific ca-\\nreer goals. Every afternoon they play waste-bin basketball with wadded-\\nup memos. One of them later recalls, \"We were voted the two guys \\nprobably least likely to succeed.\" \\nThese two young men are of interest to us now for only one reason: \\nThey are Jeffrey Immelt and Steven Ballmer, who before age fifty would \\nbecome CEOs of the world\\'s two most valuable corporations, General \\nElectric and Microsoft. Contrary to what any reasonable person would \\nhave expected when they were new recruits, they reached the absolute \\napex of corporate achievement. The obvious question is how. \\nWas it talent? If so, it was a strange kind of talent that hadn\\'t revealed \\nitself in the first twenty-two years of their lives. Was it brains? These \\n1  Talent Is Overrated \\ntwo were sharp but had shown no evidence of being sharper than \\nthousands of their classmates or colleagues. Was it mountains of hard \\nwork? Certainly not up to that point. \\nAnd yet something carried them to the heights of the business \\nworld. Which leads to perhaps the most puzzling question, one that \\napplies not just to Immelt and Ballmer but also to everyone in our \\nlives and to ourselves: If that certain something turns out not to be \\nany of the the things we usually think of, then what is it? \\nLook around you. \\nLook at your friends, your relatives, your coworkers, the people you \\nmeet when you shop or go to a party. How do they spend their days? \\nMost of them work. They all do many other things as well, playing \\nsports, performing music, pursuing hobbies, doing public service. Now \\nask yourself honestly: How well do they do what they do? \\nThe most likely answer is that they do it fine. They do it well enough \\nto keep doing it. At work they don\\'t get fired and probably get promoted \\na number of times. They play sports or pursue their other interests well \\nenough to enjoy them. But the odds are that few if any of the people \\naround you are truly great at what they do—awesomely, amazingly, \\nworld-class excellent. \\nWhy—exactly why—aren\\'t they? Why don\\'t they manage busi-\\nnesses like Jack Welch or Andy Grove, or play golf like Tiger Woods, or \\nplay the violin like Itzhak Perlman? After all, most of them are good, \\nconscientious people, and they probably work diligently. Some of them \\nhave been at it for a very long time—twenty, thirty, forty years. Why \\nisn\\'t that enough to make them great performers? It clearly isn\\'t. The \\nhard truth is that virtually none of them has achieved greatness or come \\neven close, and only a tiny few ever will. \\nThis is a mystery so commonplace that we scarcely notice it, yet it\\'s \\ncritically important to the success or failure of our organizations, the \\ncauses we believe in, and our own lives. In some cases we can give plau- \\n2  The Mystery \\nsible explanations, saying that we\\'re less than terrific at hobbies and \\ngames because we don\\'t take them all that seriously. But what about \\nour work? We prepare for it through years of education and devote \\nmost of our waking hours to it. Most of us would be embarrassed to \\nadd up the total hours we\\'ve spent on our jobs and then compare that \\nnumber with the hours we\\'ve given to other priorities that we claim are \\nmore important, like our families; the figures would show that work is \\nour real priority. Yet after all those hours and all those years, most peo-\\nple are just okay at what they do. \\nIn fact the reality is more puzzling than that. Extensive research in \\na wide range of fields shows that many people not only fail to become \\noutstandingly good at what they do, no matter how many years they \\nspend doing it, they frequently don\\'t even get any better than they were \\nwhen they started. Auditors with years of experience were no better at \\ndetecting corporate fraud—a fairly important skill for an auditor—than \\nwere freshly trained rookies. When it comes to judging personality dis-\\norders, which is one of the things we count on clinical psychologists to \\ndo, length of clinical experience told nothing about skill—\"the correla-\\ntions,\" concluded some of the leading researchers, \"are roughly zero.\" \\nSurgeons were no better at predicting hospital stays after surgery than \\nresidents were. In field after field, when it came to centrally important \\nskills —stockbrokers recommending stocks, parole officers predicting \\nrecidivism, college admissions officials judging applicants—people \\nwith lots of experience were no better at their jobs than those with very \\nlittle experience. \\nThe most recent studies of business managers confirm these results. \\nResearchers from the INSEAD business school in France and the U.S. \\nNaval Postgraduate School call the phenomenon \"the experience trap.\" \\nTheir key finding: While companies typically value experienced man-\\nagers, rigorous study shows that, on average, \"managers with experience \\ndid not produce high-caliber outcomes.\" \\nBizarre as this seems, in at least a few fields it gets one degree \\n3  Talent Is Overrated \\nodder. Occasionally people actually get worse with experience. More \\nexperienced doctors reliably score lower on tests of medical knowledge \\nthan do less experienced doctors; general physicians also become less \\nskilled over time at diagnosing heart sounds and X-rays. Auditors be-\\ncome less skilled at certain types of evaluations. \\nWhat is especially troubling about these findings is the way they \\ndeepen, rather than solve, the mystery of great performance. When \\nasked to explain why a few people are so excellent at what they do, most \\nof us have two answers, and the first one is hard work. People get ex-\\ntremely good at something because they work hard at it. We tell our \\nkids that if they just work hard, they\\'ll be fine. It turns out that this is \\nexactly right. They\\'ll be fine, just like all those other people who work \\nat something for most of their lives and get along perfectly acceptably \\nbut never become particularly good at it. The research confirms that \\nmerely putting in the years isn\\'t much help to someone who wants to \\nbe a great performer. \\nSo our instinctive first answer to the question of exceptional perfor-\\nmance does not hold up. \\nOur second answer is the opposite of the first, but that doesn\\'t stop \\nus from believing it fervently. It goes back at least twenty-six hundred \\nyears, to the time of Homer: \\nCall in the inspired bard \\nDemodocus. God has given the man the gift of song. \\nThat\\'s from the Odyssey, one of many references in it and the Iliad to \\nthe god-given gifts of various characters. We\\'ve changed our views on \\na lot of important matters since then—how the planets move, where \\ndiseases come from—but we have not changed our views on what \\nmakes some people extraordinarily good at what they do. We still think \\nwhat Homer thought: that the awesomely great, apparently super- \\n4  The Mystery \\nhuman performers around us came into this world with a gift for doing \\nexactly what they ended up doing—in the case of Demodocus, compos-\\ning and singing. We use the same words that the ancient Greeks used, \\nsimply translated. We still say, as Homer did, that great performers are \\ninspired, meaning that their greatness was breathed into them by gods \\nor muses. We still say they have a gift, which is to say their greatness \\nwas given to them, for reasons no one can explain, by someone or some-\\nthing apart from themselves. \\nWe believe further that such people had the great good fortune to \\ndiscover their gift, usually early in life. While this explanation of great \\nperformance obviously contradicts the just-work-hard explanation, it\\'s \\nmuch more deeply rooted and in some ways is more satisfying. It ex-\\nplains why great performers seem to do effortlessly certain things that \\nmost of us can\\'t imagine doing at all, whether it\\'s forming a strategy \\nfor a multibillion-dollar company or playing the Tchaikovsky Violin \\nConcerto or hitting a golf ball 33o yards. The natural-gift explanation \\nalso explains why extraordinary performers are so rare; god-given tal-\\nents are presumably not handed out willy-nilly. \\nThis explanation has the additional advantage of helping most of us \\ncome to somewhat melancholy terms with our own performance. A \\ngod-given gift is a one-in-a-million thing. You have it or you don\\'t. If \\nyou don\\'t—and of course most of us don\\'t—then it follows that you \\nshould just forget now about ever coming close to greatness. \\nThus it\\'s clear why most of us don\\'t dwell on the mystery of great \\nperformance. We don\\'t think it\\'s a mystery. We\\'ve got a couple of ex-\\nplanations in our head, and if it ever occurs to us that the first one is \\nclearly wrong, well, the second one is what we really believe anyway. \\nAnd the nicest thing about the second explanation is that it takes the \\nmatter of great performance out of our hands. If we were really a natu-\\nral at anything, we\\'d know it by now. Since we\\'re not, we can worry \\nabout other things. \\n5  Talent Is Overrated \\nThe trouble with this explanation—except it isn\\'t trouble, it\\'s excel-\\nlent news—is that it\\'s wrong. Great performance is in our hands far \\nmore than most of us ever suspected. \\nNew Findings on Great Performance \\nIt turns out that our knowledge of great performance, like our knowl-\\nedge of everything else, has actually advanced quite a bit in the past \\ncouple of millennia. It\\'s just that most of the findings haven\\'t made \\ntheir way into people\\'s heads. Scientists began turning their attention \\nto it in a big way about 15o years ago, but what\\'s most important is the \\ngrowing mountain of research that has accumulated in just the past 3o \\nyears. Conducted by scientists around the world, who have looked into \\ntop-level performance in a wide array of fields, including management, \\nchess, swimming, surgery, jet piloting, violin playing, sales, novel writ-\\ning, and many others, these hundreds of research studies have con-\\nverged on some major conclusions that directly contradict most of what \\nwe all think we know about great performance. Specifically: \\n• The gifts possessed by the best performers are not at all what we \\nthink they are. They are certainly not enough to explain the achieve-\\nments of such people—and that\\'s if these gifts exist at all. Some re-\\nsearchers now argue that specifically targeted innate abilities are simply \\nfiction. That is, you are not a natural-born clarinet virtuoso or car sales-\\nman or bond trader or brain surgeon—because no one is. Not all re-\\nsearchers are prepared to accept that view, but the talent advocates have \\na surprisingly difficult time demonstrating that even those natural gifts \\nthey believe they can substantiate are particularly important in attain-\\ning great performance. \\n• Going beyond the question of specific innate gifts, even the general \\nabilities that we typically believe characterize the greats are not what \\n6  The Mystery \\nwe think. In many realms—chess, music, business, medicine—we as-\\nsume that the outstanding performers must possess staggering intelli-\\ngence or gigantic memories. Some do, but many do not. For example, \\nsome people have become international chess masters though they pos-\\nsess below-average IQs. So whatever it is that makes these people spe-\\ncial, it doesn\\'t depend on superhuman general abilities. On that score, \\na great many of them are amazingly average. \\n• The factor that seems to explain the most about great performance \\nis something the researchers call deliberate practice. Exactly what \\nthat is and isn\\'t turns out to be extremely important. It definitely isn\\'t \\nwhat most of us do on the job every day, which begins to explain the \\ngreat mystery of the workplace—why we\\'re surrounded by so many \\npeople who have worked hard for decades but have never approached \\ngreatness. Deliberate practice is also not what most of us do when we \\nthink we\\'re practicing golf or the oboe or any of our other interests. \\nDeliberate practice is hard. It hurts. But it works. More of it equals bet-\\nter performance. Tons of it equals great performance. \\nWhile there\\'s a lot to be said about deliberate practice, a few initial \\nobservations are key: \\n• Deliberate practice is a large concept, and to say that it explains \\neverything would be simplistic and reductive. Critical questions imme-\\ndiately present themselves: What exactly needs to be practiced? Pre-\\ncisely how? Which specific skills or other assets must be acquired? The \\nresearch has revealed answers that generalize quite well across a wide \\nrange of fields. It certainly seems daunting to seek a common explana-\\ntion for greatness in ballet and medical diagnosis, or insurance sales \\nand baseball, but a few key factors do seem to account for top perfor-\\nmance in those realms and many more. \\n• Most organizations are terrible at applying the principles of great \\nperformance. Many companies seem arranged almost perfectly to pre-\\nvent people from taking advantage of these principles for themselves \\n7  Talent Is Overrated \\nor for the teams in which they work. That situation presents a great \\nopportunity for companies that understand the principles and apply \\nthem widely. \\n• One of the most important questions about greatness surrounds \\nthe difficulty of deliberate practice. The chief constraint is mental, re-\\ngardless of the field—even in sports, where we might think the physical \\ndemands are the hardest. Across realms, the required concentration is \\nso intense that it\\'s exhausting. If deliberate practice is so hard—if in \\nmost cases it\\'s \"not inherently enjoyable,\" as some of the top research-\\ners say—then why do some people put themselves through it day after \\nday for decades, while most do not? Where does the necessary passion \\ncome from? That turns out to be quite a deep question. But answers \\nare turning up. \\nThe new understanding of great performance is especially powerful \\nbecause it seems widely generalizable. Researchers continue to test it \\nin an increasingly broad range of fields, and it keeps holding up. So the \\nopportunity to apply it in all types of domains seems irresistible, and \\nindeed doing so looks increasingly like an urgent task. \\nYou might say that this new understanding has come along just in \\nthe nick of time, because the need for it in every field is greater than \\never. The reasons are many. Most apparent is the trend of rapidly rising \\nstandards in virtually every domain. To overstate only slightly, people \\neverywhere are doing and making pretty much everything better. We \\nsee examples wherever we turn, starting in our own households. You\\'re \\nwell aware that computers offer more power for fewer dollars every \\nyear, but the same phenomenon is happening across industries. How \\nlong did your parents\\' car last? Maybe 50,000 miles? If you put 200,000 \\nmiles on your new Toyota, no one will think anything of it. It\\'s a similar \\nstory with the car\\'s tires. A Whirlpool washer (or any other major \\nbrand) has more functions, uses less water, requires less electricity, and \\ncosts far less in inflation-adjusted dollars than it did five years ago. In \\n8  The Mystery \\nevery industry worldwide, businesses have to perform at the highest \\nstandard, and then get continually better, just to be competitive. Great \\nperformance is becoming more valuable. \\nThe trend is the same in virtually every field of individual human \\nperformance. Consider sports, which not only are interesting in them-\\nselves but also, as we shall see, have much to teach us about great per-\\nformance in business and other realms—and not in the old-fashioned \\nwinning-is-the-only-thing sense. We all know that sports records keep \\ngetting broken, but we generally don\\'t appreciate just how dramatic \\nthe progress has been, or the reasons for it. For example, the Olympic \\nrecords of a hundred years ago—representing the best performance of \\nany human being on the planet—today in many cases equal ho-hum \\nperformance by high schoolers. The winner of the men\\'s 200-meter race \\nin the 1908 Olympics ran it in 22.6 seconds; today\\'s high school record \\nis faster by more than 2 seconds, a huge margin. Today\\'s best high \\nschool time in the marathon beats the 1908 Olympic gold medalist by \\nmore than twenty minutes. And if you\\'re thinking it\\'s because kids \\ntoday are bigger, that\\'s not it. Recent research by Dr. Niels H. Secher of \\nthe University of Copenhagen and others shows that size is no advan-\\ntage in running, since each stride requires you to lift yourself up. \"The \\nsmaller you are, the better you are,\" he says. \\nIn any case, events in which size and power are irrelevant show the \\nsame pattern of constantly rising standards. In diving, for example, \\nthe double somersault was almost prohibited as recently as the 1924 \\nOlympics because it was considered too dangerous. Today, it\\'s boring. \\nThis matters because of why it\\'s happening: Contemporary athletes \\nare superior not because they\\'re somehow different but because they \\ntrain themselves more effectively. That\\'s an important concept for us \\nto remember. \\nStandards in intellectual disciplines are rising at least as fast as in \\nsports. Roger Bacon, the great English scholar and teacher of the thir-\\nteenth century, wrote that a person would need thirty to forty years of \\n9  Talent Is Overrated \\nstudy to master mathematics as then understood. Today the math he \\nwas talking about—calculus hadn\\'t been invented—is taught routinely \\nto millions of high school students. No one thinks anything of it, but \\nconsider what this means. The intellectual content of the material is \\nthe same, and people\\'s brains aren\\'t any different; seven hundred and \\nsome years isn\\'t nearly enough time for a broad upgrade in human \\nbrainpower. Instead, just as in sports, the standard of what we do with \\nwhat we\\'ve got has simply risen tremendously. \\nWhen Tchaikovsky finished writing his Violin Concerto in 1878, he \\nasked the famous violinist Leopold Auer to give the premier perfor-\\nmance. Auer studied the score and said no—he thought the work was \\nunplayable. Today every young violinist graduating from Juilliard can \\nplay it. The music is the same, the violins are the same, and human be-\\nings haven\\'t changed. But people have learned how to perform much, \\nmuch better. \\nNew research shows that the trend is continuing, even in realms \\nwhere the standard already seems impressively high. For example, a \\ncleverly designed study of world championship games in chess found \\nrecently that the game is being played at a far higher level today than \\nit was in the nineteenth century, when the world championship was \\nfirst contested. Using powerful chess software, the researchers found \\nthat former champions made many more tactical errors than today\\'s \\nplayers do. In fact, champions of yore would about match today\\'s play-\\ners just below the master level, not even approaching the grand master \\nor champion levels. The researchers concluded, \"these results imply \\ndramatic improvements at the highest level of intellectual achievement \\nin the game of chess over the last two centuries.\" Again, the game hasn\\'t \\nchanged, and not enough time has passed for human brains to have \\nchanged. What has changed is that people are doing much more with \\nwhat they\\'ve got. \\nIn business it\\'s overwhelmingly clear that standards of performance \\n10  The Mystery \\nwill continue to rise more relentlessly than they have in the past, thus \\nincreasing the value of great performance. The most important reason \\nis that infotech has given customers unprecedented power, and with \\nthat power they\\'re demanding more. We all understand this because \\nwe\\'ve all bought stuff online. As buyers, we receive more information \\nthan we could ever see before. We know what the car dealer paid for \\nthe car. We know what prescription drugs cost in Canada. We know \\nthat a college textbook costing $135 in the campus bookstore can be \\nordered for $70 from England. And what we know and save as consum-\\ners is nothing compared with what corporate buyers know about their \\nsuppliers, and the cost savings it has suddenly become possible to \\nsqueeze out of them. As the strategy consultant Gary Hamel likes to \\nsay, if customer ignorance is a profit center for you, you\\'re in trouble. \\nThe Challenge We All Face \\nIt isn\\'t just companies that have to keep kicking up their performance \\nmore than they ever did before. It\\'s each of us individually. The pres-\\nsure on us to keep getting better is greater than it used to be because \\nof a historic change in the economy. \\nTo understand what\\'s going on, we need to take a step back. How \\nmany offers of credit cards do you get in the mail every day? Do your \\nkids get them? How about your pet? (It has happened.) Maybe you also \\nreceive unsolicited checks with your name and address printed in the \\ncorner, and a letter urging you to write out those checks to pay some \\nbills. It\\'s happening because the world\\'s financial institutions are awash \\nin money. They literally have more than they know what to do with, \\nand they\\'re saying: Take some, please! \\nThose financial institutions aren\\'t alone. Companies of all kinds have \\nfar more money than they need. The cash held by U.S. companies is \\nhitting all-time records. Companies are using some of this money to \\n11  Talent Is Overrated \\nbuy back their own stock at record rates. When a company does this, \\nit\\'s saying to its investors: We don\\'t have any good ideas for what to do \\nwith this, so here—maybe you do. \\nThese are all manifestations of a much larger phenomenon. For \\nroughly five hundred years—from the explosion of commerce and \\nwealth that accompanied the Renaissance until the late twentieth \\ncentury—the scarce resource in business was financial capital. If \\nyou had it, you had the means to create more wealth, and if you didn\\'t, \\nyou didn\\'t. That world is now gone. Today, in a change that is histori-\\ncally quite sudden, financial capital is abundant. The scarce resource is \\nno longer money. It\\'s human ability. \\nSuch assertions run the danger of sounding like up-with-people fluff, \\nso it\\'s important to demonstrate that they\\'re true. Fortunately, the evi-\\ndence is easy to spot. It has become possible in recent years to create \\nstaggering amounts of shareholder wealth with business models that \\nuse very little financial capital but tons of human capital. For example, \\nMicrosoft has used about $3o billion of financial capital from all sources \\nover its corporate lifetime, and it has created about $221 billion of \\nshareholder wealth. By contrast, Procter & Gamble, one of the best man-\\naged and most admired companies in the world, has used far more \\ncapital than Microsoft, about $83 billion, yet has created much less \\nshareholder wealth—about $126 billion. \\nEven more dramatically, Google has used only about $5 billion of \\ncapital but has created about $124 billion of shareholder wealth. Con-\\ntrast that with, say, PepsiCo, another superbly managed company built \\non a business model from an earlier age; using much more financial \\ncapital than Google, about $34 billion, it has created much less share-\\nholder wealth, about $73 billion. \\nMicrosoft and Google understand perfectly well that their success is \\nbuilt on human capital. Both companies are famous for the scorching \\nintelligence of the people they hire and for the brutally rigorous tests \\nthey impose on job applicants. Bill Gates has said that if you took the \\n12  The Mystery \\ntwenty smartest people out of Microsoft it would be an insignificant \\ncompany, and if you ask around the company what its core competency \\nis, they don\\'t say anything about software. They say it\\'s hiring. They \\nknow what the scarce resource is. \\nWhat makes this phenomenon so significant is that it applies to all \\ncompanies, not just infotech wonders. Consider the most extreme case \\nof a company that would appear to rely almost entirely on financial \\ncapital, Exxon Mobil. It\\'s the largest company in the world, and its busi-\\nness is arguably the world\\'s most capital-intensive. In recent years it \\nhas been investing about $20 billion a year in its business, the largest \\ncapital investment program of any company in the world. But it has \\nbeen giving even more—$33 billion in 2006—back to the shareholders \\nthrough dividends and stock buybacks, the largest-ever example of \\n\"Here—maybe you can do something with this.\" I asked the CEO, Rex \\nTillerson, why he followed that policy. After all, Exxon earns tremen-\\ndous returns on the money it invests, far better than any of its major \\ncompetitors. So why not build shareholder wealth by investing more \\nthan $20 billion a year? The constraint, he says, isn\\'t money, it\\'s people: \\n\"You don\\'t just walk out on the street and hire an Exxon Mobil engineer \\nor geoscientist or researcher.\" He could fund more projects, but he \\ndoesn\\'t have enough qualified people to manage them. \\nFor virtually every company, the scarce resource today is human \\nability. That\\'s why companies are under unprecedented pressure to \\nmake sure that every employee is as highly developed as possible—and \\nas we shall see, no one knows what the limits of development are. \\nAt the same time, a separate historic trend is putting individuals \\nunder unprecedented pressure to develop their own abilities more \\nhighly than was ever necessary before, quite apart from anything their \\nemployers may or may not do to develop them. That trend is the advent \\nof the first large-scale global labor market. We\\'ve had global product \\nmarkets for centuries and global capital markets for almost as long. But \\nlabor markets were different. For most of human history, most work \\n13  Talent Is Overrated \\nhas been place-based. Often it was tied to the location of customers; \\nfarriers had to be where the horses were, bakers where the buyers were, \\nbankers where the depositors and borrowers were. Other work was tied \\nto the location of the natural resources on which it relied. Miners had \\nto be where the coal was, fishermen where the fish were. Detroit became \\nthe car capital because it was the best spot at which to bring together, \\nvia rail and Great Lakes shipping, the coal, steel, rubber, and other com-\\nponents of a car, and from which to distribute to the nation. \\nOffshoring happened for decades, but for most of that time it wasn\\'t \\na national obsession because it didn\\'t happen much; before the info \\nage, coordinating production in a foreign country was slow and cum-\\nbersome. Thus the great majority of workers competed for jobs mostly \\nwith other workers in their area, and when they competed more broadly, \\nit was mostly with workers in other parts of the country. \\nBut today, many millions of workers in developed economies com-\\npete for jobs with other workers around the world. The reason is that \\na large and growing proportion of all work is information-based and \\ndoesn\\'t involve moving or processing anything physical at all. We\\'re \\nall familiar with some of the results: workers in other countries an-\\nswering our customer service calls, reading our X-rays, writing our \\nsoftware. Other developments may be more surprising. More than \\na million American tax returns are prepared in India each year. A \\nmajor accounting firm audited a client company in London by flying \\nin a team of accountants from India, putting them up in a hotel for \\nthree weeks, and flying them back; it was much cheaper than using \\nBritish accountants. \\nIt\\'s all happening because the costs of computing power and tele-\\ncommunications are in free fall. Processing information and moving it \\naround costs practically nothing. For those same reasons, offshoring of \\nmanufacturing jobs is also exploding. Coordinating global supply \\nchains has become so fast and precise that it\\'s now worthwhile to take \\n14  The Mystery \\nadvantage of cheaper labor that happens to be halfway around the \\nworld. \\nThe result is that a fast-growing number of workers everywhere have \\nto be just as good—and just as good a value—as the very best workers \\nin their field anywhere on earth. It\\'s true that a few jobs can probably \\nescape this brutal competition, but not as many as we\\'re tempted to \\nthink. You might suppose, for example, that dentists will always have \\nto be where their patients are. Not so. Many consumers in Britain, \\nwhere dentistry is a much-criticized part of the National Health Service, \\nare taking low-fare flights to Poland to get their dental work done by \\nwell-trained dentists who charge bargain prices. \\nIf you think your job isn\\'t exportable, you may be right—but think \\nabout it hard before you relax. \\n\"World class\" is a term that gets thrown around too easily. For most \\nof history, few people had to worry about what world class was. But \\nnow that\\'s changing. In a global, information-based, interconnected \\neconomy, businesses and individuals are increasingly going up against \\nthe world\\'s best. The costs of being less than truly world class are grow-\\ning, as are the rewards of being genuinely great. \\nUnderstanding where extraordinary performance comes from would \\nbe valuable at any time. Now it\\'s crucial. \\nIt must also be said that the value of better understanding great \\nperformance is more than just economic. Not that there\\'s anything \\nwrong with prosperity; most people want to be better off, and helping \\nthem keep their jobs, fund their retirements, and pay for their kids\\' \\neducations—by helping them become better performers—can prevent \\na lot of human suffering. But there\\'s more to life than work, and there\\'s \\nmore to be good at than your job. \\nBeing good at whatever we want to do—playing the violin, running \\na race, painting a picture, leading a group of people—is among the \\n15  Talent Is Overrated \\ndeepest sources of fulfillment we will ever know. Most of what we want \\nto do is hard. That\\'s life. Encountering problems, discouragement, \\nand disappointment is inevitable. So any knowledge about what makes \\nus better at the things we want to do—real knowledge, not myth or \\nconjecture—can be used not just to make us richer but also to make us \\nhappier. \\nResearchers have uncovered and refined a great deal of such knowl-\\nedge over the past thirty years, and it holds tremendous promise \\nfor making us better at undertakings of every kind. This knowledge \\nhas not been widely dispersed or well understood, which makes the \\nopportunity of applying it all the greater. Many of the findings are sur-\\nprising; in fact, though they\\'re ultimately full of promise and even in-\\nspiration, many people resist them at first. \\nThe nineteenth-century humorist Josh Billings famously said, \"It \\nain\\'t so much the things we don\\'t know that get us into trouble. It\\'s the \\nthings we know that just ain\\'t so.\" The first step in understanding the \\nnew findings on great performance is using them to help us identify \\nwhat we know for sure that just ain\\'t so. \\n16  Chapter Two \\nTalent Is Overrated \\nConfronting the unexpected facts about innate abilities \\nIn 1992, a small group of researchers in England went looking for tal-\\nent. They couldn\\'t find it. \\nThey were looking for musical talent, which made sense, because \\nthat\\'s the kind people feel most certain about. They know it exists. They \\nknow there\\'s a reason why they can\\'t sing and other people can, or why \\nMozart could write symphonies when he was a teenager, or why some \\npeople can play the piano beautifully as mere children while others \\nstruggle to play a scale. Most people simply know that certain lucky \\nindividuals are born with a talent for music, and that\\'s the main factor \\nin how well they perform it or write it. \\nWhen researchers in a separate study polled a sample consisting \\nmainly of education professionals, more than 75 percent believed that \\nsinging, composing, and playing concert instruments requires a special \\ngift or talent; that 75 percent is a higher proportion than those who \\nbelieve particular talent is necessary in any other field. \\nSo the researchers looked at 257 young people, all of whom had been \\nintroduced to the study of music but who otherwise varied widely. They \\nwere classified into five ability groups, ranging from students at a music \\nschool who were admitted by competitive audition (the top group) to \\nstudents who had tried an instrument for at least six months but had \\ngiven it up. Researchers matched the groups by age, gender, instru-\\nments, and socioeconomic class. \\n17  Talent Is Overrated \\nThen the researchers interviewed the students and their parents at \\nlength. How much did the kids practice? At what age could they first \\nsing a recognizable tune? And so on. Fortunately for the researchers, \\nthe British educational system gave them an independent means of as-\\nsessing these students beyond the five ability groups used. A national \\nsystem of grading young instrumentalists is rigorous and uniform; the \\ngreat majority of kids studying instruments take graded exams that are \\nformulated and conducted by a national panel of assessors, who then \\nplace each student into one of nine grades. \\nThis setup let the researchers check their results two ways as they \\ntried to figure out what accounted for the wide difference in musical \\nability and achievement among their 257 subjects. \\nThe results were clear. The telltale signs of precocious musical abil-\\nity in the top-performing groups—the evidence of talent that we all \\nknow exists—simply weren\\'t there. On the contrary, judged by early \\nsigns of special talent, all the groups were highly similar. The top group, \\nthe students at music school, were superior on one measure of early \\nability—the ability to repeat a tune; they could do that at the age of \\neighteen months, on average, versus about twenty-four months for the \\nothers. But it\\'s hard to regard even that as evidence of special talent, \\nbecause the interviews revealed that the parents of these kids were far \\nmore active in singing to them than other parents were. On several \\nother dimensions the various groups of students showed no significant \\ndifferences; they all started studying their main instrument around age \\neight, for example. \\nStill, the students obviously differed dramatically in their musical \\naccomplishments, and even if extensive interviewing turned up no evi-\\ndence of particular talent, weren\\'t the differing levels of achievement \\nin themselves evidence of talent? What else could it be? As it happens, \\nthe study produced an answer to that question. One factor, and only \\none factor, predicted how musically accomplished the students were, \\nand that was how much they practiced. \\ni8  Talent Is Overrated \\nSpecifically, the researchers studied the results of those nationally \\nadministered grade-level exams. You would expect, of course, that the \\nstudents who went on to win places at the music school—and this was \\na school whose graduates regularly win national competitions and go \\non to professional music careers—would reach any given grade level \\nmore quickly and easily than the students who ended up being less ac-\\ncomplished. That\\'s the very meaning of being musically talented. But \\nit didn\\'t happen. On the contrary: The researchers calculated the aver-\\nage hours of practice needed by the most elite group of students to \\nreach each grade level, and they calculated the average hours needed \\nby each of the other groups. There were no statistically significant \\ndifferences. For students who ended up going to the elite music school \\nas well as for students who just played casually for fun, it took an aver-\\nage of twelve hundred hours of practice to reach grade 5, for example. \\nThe music school students reached grade levels at earlier ages than \\nthe other students for the simple reason that they practiced more \\neach day. \\nBy age twelve, the researchers found, the students in the most elite \\ngroup were practicing an average of two hours a day versus about \\nfifteen minutes a day for the students in the lowest group, an 800 per-\\ncent difference. So students could put in their hours a little bit each \\nday or a lot each day, but nothing, it turned out, enabled any group \\nto reach any given grade level without putting in those hours. As \\none of the researchers, Professor John A. Sloboda of the University of \\nKeele, put it: \"There is absolutely no evidence of a \\'fast track\\' for high \\nachievers.\" \\nTo put the results in their starkest terms: Shown five groups of stu-\\ndents, one of which won positions at a top-ranked music school and \\none of which gave up even trying to play an instrument, we would all \\nsay the first group is obviously immensely more talented than the lat-\\nter. But the study showed that—at least as most of us understand \"tal-\\nent,\" meaning an ability to achieve more easily—they were not. \\n19  Talent Is Overrated \\nWhat Is Talent? \\nIf it turns out that we\\'re all wrong about talent—and I will offer a lot \\nmore evidence that we are—that\\'s a big problem. If we believe that \\npeople without a particular natural talent for some activity will never \\nbe very good at it, or at least will never be competitive with those who \\npossess that talent, then we\\'ll direct them away from that activity. We\\'ll \\ntell them they shouldn\\'t even think about it. We\\'ll steer our kids away \\nfrom particular studies, whether they\\'re art, tennis, economics, or Chi-\\nnese, because we think we\\'ve seen signs that they have no talent in \\nthose realms. In business we constantly see managers redirect people\\'s \\ncareers based on slender evidence of what they\\'ve \"got.\" Most insidi-\\nously, in our own lives, we will try something new and, finding that it \\nisn\\'t easy for us, conclude that we have no talent for it, and so we never \\npursue it. \\nThus our views about talent, which are extremely deeply held, are \\nextraordinarily important for the future of our lives, our children\\'s lives, \\nour companies, and the people in them. Understanding the reality of \\ntalent is worth a great deal. \\nWe must be clear about what we mean by the term. People often use \\nit just to mean excellent performance or to describe those who are ter-\\nrific performers. \"The Red Sox have a lot of talent in the outfield\" means \\nonly that the outfielders are very good. \"The war for talent,\" a popular \\ntopic in business and the title of a book, means the fight to attract good \\nperformers. In the TV business, \"talent\" is the generic term for anyone \\nwho appears on camera. \"Get the talent on set!\" just means get the per-\\nformers to their places; anyone who watches much TV realizes that in \\nthis case the term is totally nonjudgmental. \\nNone of those meanings is the critical one. When the term is used \\nin ways that change the courses of people\\'s lives, it has a specific mean-\\ning. It is a natural ability to do something better than most people can \\ndo it. That something is fairly specific—play golf, sell things, compose \\n20  Talent Is Overrated \\nmusic, lead an organization. It can be spotted early, before the ability \\nis fully expressed. And it is innate; you\\'re born with it, and if you\\'re not \\nborn with it, you can\\'t acquire it. \\nBy this definition, most of us believe that talent exists in practically \\nevery field. Listen carefully to your next conversation about music, \\nsports, and games; it\\'s difficult to talk about participants for more than \\ntwo sentences without invoking \"talent.\" In other realms the concept is \\nnever far away. Russell Baker, the great former New York Times colum-\\nnist, believed he was born with \"the word gene,\" a writer in the making \\nliterally from birth. In business, we commonly say that Bob is a natural \\nsalesman, or Jean is a born leader, or Pat has a head for figures. Warren \\nBuffett often tells people, \"I was hardwired at birth to allocate capital,\" \\nwhich is his way of saying he came into this world with an ability to \\nspot winning investments. \\nWe\\'re all sure that talent exists, but that doesn\\'t mean we\\'ve really \\nthought about it. Hardly any of us have done that. The notion is just \\npart of our conception of the world, and it\\'s worth asking why. \\nMuch of the answer resides in an unlikely place, the writings of a \\nnineteenth-century English aristocrat and explorer who never finished \\ncollege. Francis Galton had believed as a young man that people were \\nborn with largely the same capabilities, which were developed to vary-\\ning degrees during life. Despite the ancient view from mythology and \\nreligion that all kinds of gifts were god-given, the idea of equal abilities \\nhad become popular by Galton\\'s time. It grew from deep roots in the \\neighteenth-century notions of equality that fueled the American and \\nFrench revolutions. Then Thoreau, Emerson, and others told the world \\nthat we all possess greater strength and potential than we ever imag-\\nined. The evidence flowered in nineteenth-century economic expan-\\nsion; as trade and industry thrived from Europe to America to Asia, and \\npeople found wealth and opportunity on every shore, it seemed every-\\none could make of themselves what they would. \\nGalton accepted that view—until he read the works of his cousin, \\n21  Talent Is Overrated \\nCharles Darwin. Suddenly Galton\\'s opinion reversed, and he promoted \\nhis new theory with a convert\\'s zeal. Indeed, some of his influence—\\nwhich was enormous and remains so in widely held views on this \\nissue—probably stemmed from the bulldozer confidence with which \\nhe wrote. \"I have no patience with the hypothesis occasionally ex-\\npressed, and often implied, especially in tales written to teach children \\nto be good, that babies are born pretty much alike, and that the sole \\nagencies in creating differences between boy and boy, and man and \\nman, are steady application and moral effort,\" he wrote in his founda-\\ntional work, Hereditary Genius (the possibility that girls or women \\nmight merit attention never occurred to him). \"It is in the most unquali-\\nfied manner that I object to pretensions of natural equality.\" \\nGalton\\'s view was simple: Just as height and other physical traits \\ntend to be inherited, so does \"eminence.\" He proved his theory, he said, \\nby \"showing how large is the number of instances in which men who \\nare more or less illustrious have eminent kinsfolk.\" By scouring the \\nobituaries in the Times, he assembled hundreds of pages of evidence \\nillustrating this tendency among judges, poets, commanders, musicians, \\npainters, \"divines,\" and \"wrestlers of the north country,\" among others. \\nEminence in particular fields ran in particular families. The ability to \\nachieve such eminence must therefore be inherited, present at birth. \\nThough it is tempting to smirk at someone who studied eminence \\namong wrestlers of the north country, we must not lampoon Galton. \\nBy trying to apply Darwin\\'s ideas to nonphysical human traits, he \\npushed science forward, and he advanced techniques of statistical cor-\\nrelation and regression that today are essential in all of science. He un-\\nderstood that he was raising deep questions about where greatness \\ncomes from. He coined the phrase \"nature versus nurture.\" And he es-\\ntablished what he called \"natural gifts\" as a subject of scientific inquiry, \\nwhich it has remained to this day, as seen in modern scholarly publica-\\ntions such as the Journal for the Education of the Gifted and Conceptions \\nof Giftedness. \\n22  Talent Is Overrated \\nThe idea of giftedness—which is the same as our definition of \\ntalent—thus has a very considerable head of steam behind it. But \\nwhat if the concept itself turns out to be troubled? \\nProbing the Talent Concept \\nA number of researchers now argue that giftedness or talent means \\nnothing like what we think it means, if indeed it means anything at all. \\nA few contend that the very existence of talent is not, as they carefully \\nput it, supported by evidence. \\nTheir argument is stronger than we might at first imagine. Many \\nstudies of accomplished individuals have tried to figure out the key ele-\\nments of their achievements, in part by interviewing the individuals \\nand their parents, as in the English music study mentioned earlier. In \\nthese studies, all the subjects are people of whom we\\'d say, \"They\\'re \\nvery talented.\" Yet over and over, the researchers found few signs of \\nprecocious achievement before the individuals started intensive train-\\ning. Such signs did occur occasionally, but in the large majority of cases \\nthey didn\\'t. We can all think of examples of people who seemed to be \\nhighly talented, but when researchers have looked at large numbers of \\nhigh achievers, at least in certain fields, most of the people who became \\nextremely good in their field did not show early evidence of gifts. Simi-\\nlar findings have turned up in studies of musicians, tennis players, art-\\nists, swimmers, and mathematicians. Of course such findings do not \\nprove that talent doesn\\'t exist. But they suggest an intriguing possi-\\nbility: that if it does, it may be irrelevant. \\nOnce training begins, we would suppose that talent would certainly \\nshow itself; after only three piano lessons, little Ashley is playing pieces \\nthat other kids need six months to learn. But again, this does not hap-\\npen reliably in people who go on to achieve a great deal. In a study of \\noutstanding American pianists, for example, you could not have pre-\\ndicted their eventual high level of achievement even after they\\'d been \\n23  Talent Is Overrated \\ntraining intensively for six years; at that point most of them still weren\\'t \\nstanding out from their peers. In retrospect, we\\'d say all of them were \\n\"talented,\" but talent is looking like an odd concept if it hasn\\'t made it-\\nself known after six years of hard study. \\nEven those few cases in which parents do report early, spontaneous \\nsigns of talent turn out to be problematic. Various researchers have \\nfound cases of children who reportedly spoke or read at extremely early \\nages, but they then found that the parents were deeply involved in the \\nchildren\\'s development and stimulation. Given the extraordinarily close \\nrelationship between parents and small children, it can be hard to say \\nwhat originates where. If baby Kevin smooshes paint on a piece of \\npaper in a way that looks to Mom and Dad like a bunny rabbit, they \\nmay decide he\\'s an artistic genius and begin nourishing that notion in \\nevery way they can find. We\\'ve all seen it happen, and in fact research \\nhas found that such interactions do result in differing patterns of abili-\\nties in children. We\\'ll look into this more deeply in the final chapter. \\nYou might suppose that in the age of genomic research, there should \\nno longer be any question about precisely what\\'s innate and what isn\\'t. \\nSince talent is by definition innate, there should be a gene (or genes) \\nfor it. The difficulty is that scientists haven\\'t yet figured out what each \\nof our twenty-thousand-plus genes does. All we can say for the mo-\\nment is that no specific genes identifying particular talents have been \\nfound. It\\'s possible that they will be; scientists could yet find the piano-\\nplaying gene or investing gene or accounting gene. But they haven\\'t so \\nfar, and evidence we\\'ve already seen suggests that finding talent genes \\nmay be a long shot. The extreme increases in top levels of performance \\nin a wide range of fields over the past century have happened far too \\nfast to be connected to genetic changes, which require thousands of \\nyears. For that reason, it would seem impossible to argue that genes are \\nwhat make people great at what they do. The most one could say is that \\nif genes exert any influence, it would seem to be much less than the \\nwhole explanation for achieving the highest levels of performance. \\n24  Talent Is Overrated \\nTalent skeptics are careful to say that the evidence, taken together, \\ndoesn\\'t prove that talent is a myth. They allow that further research \\ncould eventually show that individual genetic differences are what \\nmake the greatest performers so accomplished. But hundreds of stud-\\nies conducted over decades have failed to show this. On the contrary, \\nthe preponderance of them have suggested very powerfully that genetic \\ndifferences of this particular type—that is, differences that determine \\nthe highest levels of performance—don\\'t exist. \\nWhat About Mozart? \\nAnd yet ... how can this be? The antitalent argument may sound sen-\\nsible at each step, but at the end we\\'re still left with the job of explain-\\ning the transcendent greatness of history\\'s most magical, most enduring \\nperformers. And how can one possibly account for staggering, immor-\\ntal achievement except as a mysterious divine gift? In fact, when first \\npresented with the logic of the antitalent thesis, a great many people \\nrespond immediately with two simple counterarguments: Mozart and \\nTiger Woods. \\nMozart is the ultimate example of the divine-spark theory of great-\\nness. Composing music at age five, giving public performances as a pia-\\nnist and violinist at age eight, going on to produce hundreds of works, \\nsome of which are widely regarded as ethereally great and treasures of \\nWestern culture, all in the brief time before his death at age thirty-\\nfive—if that isn\\'t talent, and on a mammoth scale, then nothing is. \\nThe facts are worth examining a little more closely. Mozart\\'s father \\nwas of course Leopold Mozart, a famous composer and performer in \\nhis own right. He was also a domineering parent who started his son \\non a program of intensive training in composition and performing at \\nage three. Leopold was well qualified for his role as little Wolfgang\\'s \\nteacher by more than just his own eminence; he was deeply interested \\nin how music was taught to children. While Leopold was only so-so as \\n25  Talent Is Overrated \\na musician, he was highly accomplished as a pedagogue. His authorita-\\ntive book on violin instruction, published the same year Wolfgang was \\nborn, remained influential for decades. \\nSo from the earliest age, Wolfgang was receiving heavy instruction \\nfrom an expert teacher who lived with him. Of course his early compo-\\nsitions still seem remarkable, but they raise some provocative questions. \\nIt\\'s interesting to note that the manuscripts are not in the boy\\'s own \\nhand; Leopold always \"corrected\" them before anyone saw them. It \\nseems noteworthy also that Leopold stopped composing at just the time \\nhe began teaching Wolfgang. \\nIn some cases it\\'s clear that the young boy\\'s compositions are not \\noriginal. Wolfgang\\'s first four piano concertos, composed when he was \\neleven, actually contain no original music by him. He put them together \\nout of works by other composers. He wrote his next three works of this \\ntype, today not classified as piano concertos, at age sixteen; these also \\ncontain no original music but instead are arrangements of works by \\nJohann Christian Bach, with whom Wolfgang had studied in London. \\nMozart\\'s earliest symphonies, brief works written when he was just \\neight, hew closely to the style of Johann Christian Bach, with whom he \\nwas studying when they were written. \\nNone of these works is regarded today as great music or even close. \\nThey are rarely performed or recorded except as novelties, of inter-\\nest only because of Mozart\\'s later fame. They seem instead to be the \\nworks of someone being trained as a composer by the usual methods—\\ncopying, arranging, and imitating the works of others—with the result-\\ning products brought to the world\\'s attention (and just maybe polished \\na bit) by a father who spent much of his life promoting his son. Mozart\\'s \\nfirst work regarded today as a masterpiece, with its status confirmed \\nby the number of recordings available, is his Piano Concerto No. 9, com-\\nposed when he was twenty-one. That\\'s certainly an early age, but we \\nmust remember that by then Wolfgang had been through eighteen \\nyears of extremely hard, expert training. \\n26  Talent Is Overrated \\nThis is worth pausing to consider. Any divine spark that Mozart may \\nhave possessed did not enable him to produce world-class work quickly \\nor easily, which is something we often suppose a divine spark will do. \\nMozart\\'s method of composing was not quite the wonder it was long \\nthought to be. For nearly two hundred years many people have believed \\nthat he had a miraculous ability to compose entire major pieces in his \\nhead, after which writing them down was mere clerical work. That view \\nwas based on a famous letter in which he says as much: \"the whole, \\nthough it be long, stands almost finished and complete in my mind . . . \\nthe committing to paper is done quickly enough .. . and it rarely differs \\non paper from what it was in my imagination.\" \\nThat report certainly does portray a superhuman performer. The \\ntrouble is, this letter is a forgery, as many scholars later established. \\nMozart did not conceive whole works in his mind, perfect and com-\\nplete. Surviving manuscripts show that Mozart was constantly revising, \\nreworking, crossing out and rewriting whole sections, jotting down \\nfragments and putting them aside for months or years. Though it makes \\nthe results no less magnificent, he wrote music the way ordinary hu-\\nmans do. \\nRecent scholarship has put his abilities as a prodigy performer in a \\nnew perspective as well. Researchers constructed a \"precocity index\" for \\npianists; they figured out the number of years of study needed by a pia-\\nnist under modern training programs before publicly performing vari-\\nous works, and then compared that with the number of years actually \\nneeded by several prodigies throughout history. If the average music \\nstudent needs six years of preparation before publicly playing a piece, \\nand a given prodigy did it after three years, that student would have an \\nindex of zoo percent. Mozart\\'s index is around 13o percent, clearly ahead \\nof average students. But twentieth-century prodigies score 30o percent \\nto 500 percent. This is another example of rising standards. The effects \\nof today\\'s improved training methods apparently swamp the effects of \\nMozart\\'s genius as a performer. \\n27  Talent Is Overrated \\nTo repeat, these facts obviously don\\'t affect our regard for Mozart\\'s \\nmusic. But they drain a lot of the magic and romance out of how it was \\ncreated, and some people don\\'t like that. In a paper titled \"Mozart as a \\nWorking Stiff,\" Mozart scholar Neal Zaslaw describes what happened \\nwhen he suggested at a Mozart conference in Vienna that the adult \\ncomposer was focused on turning out product because he needed the \\nmoney and rarely if ever wrote a work for which he wasn\\'t being paid. \\n\"I was quite taken aback at the vehemence with which my remarks were \\nattacked,\" he recalls. \"The moderator of the session took it upon himself \\nto denounce me from the chair.\" The offense was suggesting that Mo-\\nzart was merely a human performer with human motivations, not a \\ndemigod propelled solely by the divine spark. \\nThat incident raises a significant issue that recurs in judging the \\ngreatness of anyone whose field is creative and artistic. We can measure \\nquite precisely the achievements of athletes, chess players, and others \\nwhose work can be evaluated objectively. In the world of finance, fund \\nmanagers and other investors are judged by criteria that can be carried \\nto several decimal places. Even scientists can be judged fairly objec-\\ntively, if not too precisely, by the influence of their work in the years \\nafter it was done. But composers, painters, poets, and other creators are \\njudged by standards that inevitably shift, so we must at least be careful \\nin drawing conclusions based on their greatness. Some artists have \\nbeen celebrated in their lifetimes and then forgotten by posterity; oth-\\ners were ignored in life and \"discovered\" only later. J. S. Bach\\'s St. Mat-\\nthew Passion, now widely regarded as one of the greatest musical works \\never written, was apparently performed only twice in his lifetime; \\nthough the fact strikes us today as incredible, Bach\\'s music in general \\nwas not especially esteemed after his death until Felix Mendelssohn \\nchampioned it decades later. (Mendelssohn\\'s own music would be \\nwidely scorned after his death, though it\\'s highly popular today.) The \\nimportant point is that if we had been studying greatness in 18 io, we \\nprobably wouldn\\'t have paid much attention to Bach, or in 1910 to \\n28  Talent Is Overrated \\nMendelssohn. As for Mozart, the angry moderator of Zaslaw\\'s panel \\ninsisted that Mozart\\'s music could not even be compared with that of \\nhis contemporaries because it \"belonged only to the highest spheres of \\ncreativity.\" To which Zaslaw responded that \"Mozart\\'s music ascended \\ninto the higher ether only in the course of the nineteenth century. Dur-\\ning his lifetime, it was right down on the ground along with that of the \\nother composers.\" \\nRegarding how he produced this music, however it\\'s evaluated, the \\nNew Yorker\\'s music critic, Alex Ross, sums up much of the recent schol-\\narship on the Miracle of Salzburg: \"Ambitious parents who are currently \\nplaying the \\'Baby Mozart\\' video for their toddlers may be disappointed \\nto learn that Mozart became Mozart by working furiously hard.\" \\nAnd Tiger? \\nResearchers on great performance sometimes call Tiger Woods the Mo-\\nzart of golf, and the parallels do seem striking. Woods\\'s father, Earl, was \\na teacher, specifically a teacher of young men, and he had a lifelong \\npassion for sports. He spent the first half of his career in the army, \\nwhere, he says, his assignments included teaching military history, tac-\\ntics, and war games to cadets at the City College of New York. In high \\nschool and college (Kansas State) he had been a star baseball player, \\nand in the time between college and the army he would coach Little \\nLeague teams \"and take them to the state tournament,\" he wrote in a \\nlittle-noticed book, Training a Tiger, published shortly before Tiger \\nturned pro. \"I love to teach,\" he said. \\nEarl had plenty of time to teach his son and was intensely focused \\non doing so. His wife Kultida and their son, Tiger, were Earl\\'s second \\nfamily. He had married young and had three children with his first wife, \\nbut that marriage ended in divorce. By the time Tiger came along, Earl\\'s \\nprevious children were grown, he had retired from the army, and at \\nage forty-four he was working for McDonnell Douglas in Southern \\n29  Talent Is Overrated \\nCalifornia. He was also fanatical about golf. He had been introduced to \\nthe game only a couple of years earlier but had worked extremely hard \\nat it and had achieved a handicap in the low single digits, placing him \\nin the top 10 percent of players. When Tiger was born, Earl wrote, \"I \\nhad been properly trained and was ready to go. I took over new ground \\nin starting Tiger at an unthinkably early age.\" \\nSo here\\'s the situation: Tiger is born into the home of an expert \\ngolfer and confessed \"golf addict\" who loves to teach and is eager to \\nbegin teaching his new son as soon as possible. Earl\\'s wife does not \\nwork outside the home, and they have no other children; they have de-\\ncided that \"Tiger would be the first priority in our relationship,\" Earl \\nwrote. Earl gives Tiger his first metal club, a putter, at the age of seven \\nmonths. He sets up Tiger\\'s high chair in the garage, where Earl is hit-\\nting balls into a net, and Tiger watches for hours on end. \"It was like a \\nmovie being run over and over and over for his view,\" Earl wrote. Earl \\ndevelops new techniques for teaching the grip and the putting stroke \\nto a student who cannot yet talk. Before Tiger is two, they are at the golf \\ncourse playing and practicing regularly. \\nTiger\\'s prodigious achievements have become well known; he was \\na local celebrity by the time he reached elementary school and became \\nnationally famous in college. Amid all that has been written about his \\nlegend, a couple of facts are especially worth noting. First is the age at \\nwhich he initially achieved outstanding performance at a level of play \\ninvolving regular international competition. Let\\'s call it age nineteen, \\nwhen he was a member of the U.S. team in Walker Cup play (though \\nhe did not win his match). At that point he had been practicing golf \\nwith tremendous intensity, first under his father and after age four \\nunder professional teachers, for seventeen years. \\nSecond, neither Tiger nor his father suggested that Tiger came into \\nthis world with a gift for golf. Earl did not believe that Tiger was an or-\\ndinary kid (but, then, parents hardly ever believe that). He thought Tiger \\nhad an unusual ability to understand what he was told and to keep track \\n30  Talent Is Overrated \\nof numbers even before he could count very high. Tiger has repeatedly \\ncredited his father for his success. Trying to understand his early inter-\\nest in the game, he has not invoked an inborn fascination. Rather, he \\nhas written, \"golf for me was an apparent attempt to emulate the per-\\nson I looked up to more than anyone: my father.\" Asked to explain Ti-\\nger\\'s phenomenal success, father and son always gave the same reason: \\nhard work. \\nOne of Tiger\\'s boyhood coaches later recalled that, on first seeing \\nhim, \"I felt he was like Mozart.\" As indeed he was. \\nIn Search of Business Talent \\nIf the concept of specific talents turns out to be troublesome in music \\nand sports, it\\'s even more so in business. We all tend to assume that \\nbusiness giants must possess some special gift for what they do, but \\nevidence turns out to be extremely elusive. In fact, the overwhelming \\nimpression that comes from examining the early lives of business greats \\nis just the opposite—that they didn\\'t seem to hold any identifiable gift \\nor give any early indication of what they would become. \\nTo consider a few of the most prominent examples: Jack Welch, \\nnamed by Fortune magazine as the twentieth century\\'s manager of the \\ncentury, showed no particular inclination toward business, even into \\nhis midtwenties. He grew up as a high-achieving kid in Salem, Massa-\\nchusetts, getting good grades, though \"no one would have accused me \\nof being brilliant,\" he later wrote, and becoming captain of his high \\nschool\\'s hockey and golf teams. It was a good enough record to get him \\ninto an Ivy League college, but his family couldn\\'t afford it, and he \\nended up going to the University of Massachusetts. He majored not in \\nbusiness or economics but in chemical engineering. He then went to \\nthe University of Illinois and got a master\\'s and a Ph.D. in the same \\nfield. As he approached the real world at age twenty-five, he still wasn\\'t \\nsure of his direction and interviewed for faculty jobs at Syracuse and \\n31  Talent Is Overrated \\nWest Virginia universities. He finally decided to accept an offer to work \\nin a chemical development operation at General Electric. \\nIf anything in Welch\\'s history to that point suggests that he would \\nbecome the most influential business manager of his time, it\\'s tough—\\nin fact, impossible—to spot it. \\nBill Gates, the world\\'s richest human and symbol of a fundamental \\neconomic revolution, is a more promising prospect for those who want \\nto explain success through talent. He became fascinated by computers \\nas a kid and says he wrote his first piece of software at age thirteen; it \\nwas a program that played tic-tac-toe. Gates and his friend Paul Allen, \\nwith whom he later founded Microsoft, were constantly contriving ways \\nto get more computer time on the big clunky machines of the day. They \\nstarted a business, Traf-O-Data, to build computers that would analyze \\nthe data from traffic monitors on city streets; Gates says the device \\nworked, but nobody bought it. After going off to Harvard, he remained \\nimmersed in the exciting and fast-changing world of computers. \\nIt\\'s clear that Gates\\'s early interests led directly to Microsoft. The \\nproblem is that nothing in his story suggests extraordinary abilities. As \\nhe is the first to note, legions of kids were interested in the possibilities \\nof computers in those days. Harvard at that time was bursting with \\ncomputer geeks who well understood that a technology revolution was \\nhappening. What suggested that Gates would become the king of them \\nall? The answer is, nothing in particular. On close examination, it was \\nprobably not his software expertise that was most critical to his success. \\nThe more relevant abilities were the ability to launch a business and \\nthen the quite different abilities required to manage a large corpora-\\ntion. And Traf-O-Data notwithstanding, one looks in vain for signs of \\nthose abilities in world-class proportions, or at all, in the young Gates. \\nIn surveying the world\\'s business titans we find Welch-like stories \\nmore often than Gates-like stories, lacking even a hint of inclination \\ntoward the fields or traits that would one day lead to fame and riches. \\nOne of Gates\\'s predecessors as the world\\'s richest man, John D. Rocke- \\n32  Talent Is Overrated \\nfeller, illustrates the point. He grew up as a poor, pious boy, hardwork-\\ning, notable mainly for his seriousness and maturity. But as his most \\ndistinguished biographer, Ron Chernow, observes, \"In many respects \\nJohn was forgettable and indistinguishable from many other boys. \\nWhen he later dazzled the world, many former neighbors and class-\\nmates struggled to summon up even a fuzzy image of him.\" One thing \\nmany acquaintances did recall was young John\\'s firmly stated intention \\nto become rich. But then, Chernow notes, \"There was nothing unusual \\nabout Rockefeller\\'s boyhood dreams, for the times were feeding avari-\\ncious fantasies in millions of susceptible schoolboys.\" The most typical \\nassessment seems to come from a woman who tutored the Rockefeller \\nchildren and later recalled, \"I have no recollection of John excelling at \\nanything. I do remember he worked hard at everything; not talking \\nmuch, and studying with great industry.\" \\nOver and over we find these stories of the early life that tell us noth-\\ning of what\\'s to come, sometimes in even more extreme form. David \\nOgilvy, regarded by many as the greatest advertising executive of the \\ntwentieth century, was expelled from Oxford, slaved in a hotel kitchen \\nin Paris, sold stoves in Scotland, and farmed in Pennsylvania, among \\nmany other apparently random occupations that consumed the first \\nseventeen years of his career. Predicting that he would make his mark \\nas an advertising legend would have been difficult, considering that he \\npresented precious little evidence that he would make any mark at all. \\nBut what about Warren Buffett, yet another of the world\\'s richest \\nmen, quoted earlier as saying he was born to allocate capital? He \\nshowed not only early signs of interest in his eventual field of emi-\\nnence, like Gates, but also precocity. As a boy, Buffett was intensely in-\\nterested in learning about business and investing, and he wanted to \\nmake money. He ran several newspaper routes, and at age eleven he \\nbought his first stock, Cities Service preferred. At fifteen, he and a \\nfriend bought a used pinball machine and installed it in a barbershop; \\nwithin a few months they\\'d added two more machines. Buffett used his \\n33  Talent Is Overrated \\nprofits to buy forty acres of farmland, which he rented to farmers. He \\nwas also known as a kid who could add large numbers in his head, and \\nhe graduated from high school at sixteen. Later, in graduate school at \\nColumbia, he studied under the famous investing authority Benjamin \\nGraham and received the only A+ that Graham ever awarded. \\nBuffett\\'s achievements as an investor are world famous, and his story \\nmakes it easy to understand why he and many others would say he was \\nborn to do what he did. But that explanation—an inborn ability to al-\\nlocate capital—is not the only way or even the easiest way to account \\nfor his success. Buffett\\'s early obsessive interest in money seems un-\\nsurprising in someone growing up in the Midwest in the Depression. \\nSimilarly, his fascination with stocks and investing is not especially in-\\ntriguing when one considers that his father was a stockbroker and in-\\nvestor whom young Warren adored. Warren went to work in his father\\'s \\noffice at age eleven and thus began learning about investing at a very \\nearly age. Yet there\\'s little if any evidence that, even into his early twen-\\nties, he was especially good at it. For a while in his teens he was an en-\\nthusiastic \"chartist,\" trying to predict the movements of stock prices by \\nstudying charts of past movements; research has shown this technique \\nto be worthless as a way to beat the market (though, like many ineffec-\\ntive techniques, it still has believers). Later he tried to be a market timer, \\nchoosing the perfect moments to get into and out of stocks; this strat-\\negy also is a guaranteed loser over time, and Buffett couldn\\'t make it \\nwork. \\nWhen Buffett graduated from Columbia Business School, he was \\nsuch a devotee of his professor, Graham, that he volunteered to work \\nfor Graham\\'s investment company for free. But, as Buffett tells the story, \\n\"Ben made his customary calculation of value to price and said no.\" Buf-\\nfett did go to work for Graham\\'s firm a couple of years later, staying for \\ntwo years, and then went back to Omaha to start his first investment \\npartnership at age twenty-five. \\nSo at this point we have a picture of a young man who had shown \\n34  Talent Is Overrated \\nan intense interest in money and investing from an early age and who \\n(like Rockefeller) possessed a powerful compulsion to become rich. He \\nhad worked extremely hard at learning all about the field that obsessed \\nhim. But he had not yet achieved anything even approaching extraor-\\ndinary real-world performance. By the time Buffett began accumulating \\na world-class record of performance, he was well into his thirties—and \\nhad been working diligently in his chosen field for more than twenty \\nyears. \\nStill—there were lots of stockbrokers\\' sons in the Depression, and \\nonly one of them ber me Warren Buffett. Why? That\\'s a large and deep \\nquestion that we\\'ll examine further; the key point for the moment is \\nthat the concept of innate business talent is not looking like a very \\npromising answer to the question of how Buffett or any of the business \\ngreats became who they were. \\nMore generally, it seems we need to recalibrate our views on the role \\nof specific, innate talents. We need not be absolutists about the matter. \\nHeated arguments over whether such talents exist at all are best left to \\nthe scholarly researchers. For most of us, the critically important point \\nis that, at the very least, these talents are much less important than we \\nusually think. They seem not to play the crucial role that we generally \\nassign to them, and it\\'s far from clear what role they do play. In chap-\\nters 4, 5, 6, 9, and 10, I will share much more evidence on this matter. \\nBut even if we have to admit that the case for the central role of \\nspecific talent is weak, we may still believe that great achievement re-\\nquires exceptional, and inborn, general abilities. You don\\'t reach the \\nhigh elevations of any field without an IQ that\\'s off the charts or an \\nXXL memory. Or so we tend to assume. But this belief also, deep-seated \\nthough it may be, is worth closer examination. \\n35  Chapter Three \\nHow Smart Do You Have to Be? \\nThe true role of intelligence and memory \\nin high achievement \\nOn July 11, 1978, in a psychology lab at Carnegie Mellon University in \\nPittsburgh, an undergraduate who would become known in the scien-\\ntific literature as SF sat trying to remember a list of random numbers. \\nHe was a subject in an experiment being conducted by Professor Wil-\\nliam Chase, a famous researcher in psychology, and a postdoctoral fel-\\nlow named Anders Ericsson. They were testing SF and other subjects \\non a standard memory test known as the digit span task: A researcher \\nreads a list of random digits at the rate of one per second; after a pause \\nof twenty seconds, the subject then repeats as many digits, in order, as \\nhe or she can remember. Psychologists had been running this test on \\nsubjects for many years. What was so interesting about SF was the ex-\\ntraordinary number of digits he could recall. \\nIf you\\'re like most people, you\\'ll max out at around seven numbers \\non the digit span task. You may get to nine, but going further is rare. \\n(It\\'s harder than remembering a phone number; try it.) Another of \\nChase and Ericsson\\'s subjects had been tested an hour a day for nine \\ndays and had never gone beyond nine digits; he had dropped out of the \\nstudy, insisting no further improvement was possible. In a much earlier \\nstudy, two subjects had managed to increase their digit span to fourteen \\nafter many hours of testing. But on this day, SF was being asked to re-\\ncall twenty-two digits, a new record. The toll it was taking on him was \\nlarge. \\n36  How Smart Do You Have to Be? \\n\"All right, all right, all right,\" he muttered after Ericsson read him the \\nlist. \"All right! All right. Oh . . geez!\" He clapped his hands loudly three \\ntimes, then grew quiet and seemed to focus further. \"Okay. Okay. . . . \\nFour-thirteen-point-one!\" he yelled. He was bre athing heavily. \"Seventy-\\nseven eighty-four !\" He was nearly screaming. \"Oh six oh three!\" Now he \\nwas screaming. \"Four-nine-four, eight-seven-oh!\" Pause. \"Nine-forty-six!\" \\nScreeching now. Only one digit left. But it isn\\'t there. \"Nine-forty-six-\\npoint . . Oh, nine-forty-six-point . . .\" He was screaming and sounding \\ndesperate. Finally, hoarse and strangled: \"TWO!\" \\nHe had done it. As Ericsson and Chase checked the results, there \\ncame a knock on the door. It was the campus police. They\\'d had a report \\nof someone screaming in the lab area. \\nWhat SF Started \\nSF\\'s achievement was significant in a couple of ways. His record of \\ntwenty-two digits didn\\'t stand for long. He kept setting new records \\n(soon without screaming), until eventually, after about 25o hours of \\ntraining over a period of two years, he could recall eighty-two digits. To \\nappreciate what that means, imagine someone reading you the follow-\\ning list of numbers, one per second: \\n8 3 7 2 6 8 9 2 7 8 6 2 7 9 2 5 0 8 9 8 3 6 8 4 0 8 0 4 2 6 2 8 9 1 9 9 9 6 3 \\n927782134317189651824657529144526437853  \\n5087  \\nKeeping that list in your head, in order, after hearing it once would \\nseem simply impossible. Yet SF\\'s memory, when tested, had been aver-\\nage before he began training. His grades were very good, but his intel-\\nligence, when measured by standardized tests, was average. Nothing \\nabout him suggested that he would ever achieve amazing feats of \\nmemory. \\n37  Talent Is Overrated \\nIn addition, while he stopped training at 82 digits, nothing in his \\nprogress to that point indicated that he had reached his limit. In fact, a \\nfriend of his who later became a research subject of Chase and Ericsson \\nreached 102 digits, with no indication that he had reached his limit. \\nChase and Ericsson concluded, \"There is apparently no limit to improve-\\nments in memory skill with practice.\" \\nThat was the first significance of SF—showing that a person of aver-\\nage general abilities could nonetheless extend one of those abilities to \\nlevels that would seem unimaginable. How he did it turned out to be \\ncritically important, as we shall see. \\nThe second significance was that the experiment planted a seed in \\nthe mind of Anders Ericsson, who would go on to become the preemi-\\nnent researcher in the field of great performance. For him, SF exempli-\\nfied what he calls \"the remarkable potential of \\'ordinary\\' adults and \\ntheir amazing capacity for change with practice.\" That is the theme of \\nhis research over the past thirty years. It has taken him far beyond the \\nstudy of memory, but it\\'s appropriate that that\\'s where it began, because \\nmemory, along with general intelligence, is widely regarded as a key \\nskill of great performers. \\nWhat Does \"Smart\" Mean? \\nThat\\'s especially true in business. For example, former GE chief Jack \\nWelch was famous for seeming to remember everything about one of \\nthe world\\'s largest and most complicated companies, the kind of guy \\nwho could spot an inconsistency on the twenty-sixth line of a financial \\nstatement during an operating review that was glazing everyone else\\'s \\neyes. Such stories are quite common among preeminent executives. A \\ngeneration earlier, Harold Geneen of ITT was legendary for the same \\nability. \\nBesides prodigious memories, high-performing businesspeople often \\nseem to have tremendous intellects. Warren Buffett is famous for doing \\n38  How Smart Do You Have to Be? \\ncomplicated math in his head. He claims not to own a calculator, and \\ngiven his reputation for honesty, there\\'s no reason to doubt him. Steve \\nRoss, who built the Warner Communications empire before selling it \\nto Time Inc., was known for analyzing complex deals in his head and \\nconsidered this ability a personal competitive advantage. He suppos-\\nedly said, \"I hate calculators. They\\'re the equalizer.\" Andy Grove, the \\ngreat former CEO of Intel, radiates intellect and was known to give little \\nslack to subordinates who couldn\\'t keep up. The same is true of Barry \\nDiller, who built exceptional careers in television, movies, and the \\nInternet. \\nEven if we\\'re prepared to question the notion that certain people \\ncome into this world with specific gifts for business, most of us still as-\\nsume that the greats possess tremendous general abilities, especially \\nintelligence and memory. We see individuals—Welch, Buffett, and \\nmany others—who seem to prove the point, and plenty of other exam-\\nples as well. Goldman Sachs, the most highly regarded firm on Wall \\nStreet, has long been known for hiring only the smartest graduates of \\nthe most elite schools. McKinsey & Company, the king of consulting \\nfirms, regularly hires most of the Baker Scholars—the most outstand-\\ning students—at the Harvard Business School. Microsoft and Google \\nare famous for grilling job applicants with questions that would leave \\nmost people begging for mercy. Everywhere we see hypersuccessful \\ncompanies seemingly filled with people who got perfect scores on their \\nSATs. \\nSo it\\'s definitely surprising, at least at first, to find that research \\ndoesn\\'t support the view that extraordinary natural general abilities—\\nas distinct from developed abilities like SF\\'s memory—are necessary \\nfor high achievement. In fact, in a wide range of fields, including busi-\\nness, the connection between general intelligence and specific abilities \\nis weak and in some cases apparently nonexistent. As for memory, the \\nwhole concept of a powerful memory is problematic because it turns \\nout that memory ability is very clearly created rather than innate. \\n39  Talent Is Overrated \\nObviously the most successful people in business or any other do-\\nmain have something special. But what is it? The idea that it\\'s an inborn \\ngift for cost accounting or writing software or trading cocoa futures \\ndoesn\\'t seem to hold up. Harder to believe is that it isn\\'t even more \\ngeneral cognitive abilities. That\\'s what the research is telling us, but it\\'s \\nso counterintuitive that it requires some explanation. \\nWe begin by delving briefly into the heavily fraught and extremely \\ndeep concept of intelligence. What do we mean when we say someone \\nis smart? It\\'s one of those concepts that we understand intuitively, but \\nthen we dwell on it and realize how complicated it is. Some people seem \\nsmart with numbers, others with words, others with abstract concepts, \\nstill others with concrete knowledge, and how do all those kinds of \\nsmart fit together? It seems likely that if we sat down and thought \\nabout it, most of us would come up with a basic definition of smart that \\nparallels closely the much maligned concept of IQ. \\nTests of IQ, as they have been developed over the past century, actu-\\nally consist of ten subtests that try to capture various aspects of in-\\ntelligence (the subtests focus on information, arithmetic, vocabulary, \\ncomprehension, picture completion, block design, object assembly, cod-\\ning, picture arrangement, and similarities). After giving these tests \\nto millions of people, researchers have found that performance on the \\nsubtests is correlated, that is, people who perform well on one of \\nthe subtests tend to perform well on all of them. Why? The researchers \\nhypothesized that there must be some general factor that influences \\nperformance on all the subtests, and they called this factor general in-\\ntelligence, or g. That\\'s what IQ measures. \\nAn assortment of academics and nonspecialists have been beating \\nup on IQ for years, largely because of what it doesn\\'t measure and \\ndoesn\\'t explain, and many of these attacks are justified. For example, \\ncritical thinking is obviously important in the real world, and IQ doesn\\'t \\nmeasure it. Ditto with social skills, honesty, tolerance, wisdom, and \\nother traits that we value and would love to understand better; they\\'re \\n40  How Smart Do You Have to Be? \\nnot on the IQ test. In response, writers and researchers over the years \\nhave proposed new concepts of what they call other types of intel-\\nligence. Most notable is Harvard professor Howard Gardner, whose \\ntheory of multiple intelligences (linguistic, musical, visual/spatial, and \\nat least five others) has been highly influential. Daniel Goleman has \\nwritten best-selling books on what he calls emotional intelligence, or \\nEQ—the many factors (self-control, zeal, persistence, and others) that \\nseem to contribute to success in real-world relationships from marriage \\nto the workplace. These concepts can be highly useful, itlthough calling \\nthem types of intelligence may not be, because it fuzzes up the concept \\nof intelligence. One of the most famous intelligence researchers, Arthur \\nJensen, has said it\\'s like calling chess an athletic skill. We certainly want \\nto study chess, but classifying it in that way may only slow down our \\nunderstanding of where athletic skill comes from. \\nSo for the moment we stick with the concept of general intelligence \\nas g, measured by IQ. It has a pretty good record. It predicts fairly well \\n(though far from perfectly) how people will perform in school. Profes-\\nsor James R. Flynn, an eminent intelligence researcher, reports that \\npeople in professional, managerial, and technical jobs have an above-\\naverage IQ as a group. Among workers overall, average IQ increases \\nwith the complexity of the work, which seems totally unsurprising. It \\nsupports what most of us would suppose: Smarter people do better. \\nResearch says they do more demanding work and achieve higher socio-\\neconomic status. When we think of intelligence in the general, old-\\nfashioned, academic sense, then particle physicists are smarter than \\ndentists, who are smarter than assembly-line workers, on average. So \\na mass of evidence seems to undergird the view that even if the \\nworld\\'s great performers don\\'t possess a specific, targeted gift, they \\nstill have some more general natural advantage, most likely superior \\nintelligence. \\nThe trouble starts when we dig beneath the averages. Consider your \\nown acquaintances. You are virtually guaranteed to know people who \\n41  Talent Is Overrated \\nhave succeeded in the business world, sometimes very considerably, \\nwithout evincing conventional brainpower that\\'s in any way impres-\\nsive. We typically explain this by saying they\\'re good with people, or \\nthey work extremely hard, or they really put their heart into it. Such \\nfactors may relate to Gardner\\'s multiple \"intelligences\" or Goleman\\'s \\nEQ, but the critical point is that whatever these people have, it definitely \\nis not general intelligence—our first hint that IQ may not explain great \\nperformance as well as we usually suspect it might. \\nThe evidence is actually far more substantial than our own random \\nexperiences. A wide range of research shows that the correlations \\nbetween IQ and achievement aren\\'t nearly as strong as the data on \\nbroad averages would suggest, and in many cases there\\'s no correlation \\nat all. \\nConsider, for example, a study of salespeople. This was a so-called \\nmeta-analysis, the largest of its type ever conducted, gathering data \\nfrom several dozen previous studies looking at almost forty-six thou-\\nsand individuals. Studying businesspeople in the real world is tough \\nbecause you generally can\\'t control the conditions, and the results are \\noften unclear; whether a decision was good or bad may not be known \\nfor years. Salespeople make attractive subjects for researchers because \\nat least they produce something clear to measure: sales. There may still \\nbe endless sources of noise in the results, as salespeople explain elo-\\nquently to their bosses, but over time and over large numbers of sub-\\njects, most of that should wash out. \\nIn this analysis of analyses, the researchers found that if you ask \\nsalespeople\\'s bosses to rate them, the ratings track intelligence moder-\\nately well; bosses tend to think that smarter salespeople are better. But \\nwhen the researchers compared intelligence with actual sales results, \\nthey found nothing. Intelligence was virtually useless in predicting how \\nwell a salesperson would perform. Whatever it is that makes a sales ace, \\nit seems to be something other than brainpower. \\nThese results are surprising also because they suggest that sales \\n42  How Smart Do You Have to Be? \\nsupervisors are deluding themselves. You\\'d think they would have every \\nincentive to know the objective performance of their subordinates and \\nrate them on that basis, but apparently they do not. That finding has \\nbeen supported in at least one other large meta-analysis. It seems our \\nview that intelligence necessarily produces better performance is so \\ndeep that it may occasionally even blind us to reality. \\nA more detailed investigation of real-world performance focused on \\nan activity that has a lot in common with business: betting on horses. \\nYou study the facts, you estimate odds, and you decide where to put \\nyour money; it isn\\'t so different from management. The researchers \\nwent to a track and recruited a group of subjects. Based on their ability \\nto forecast post-time odds, these subjects were deemed experts or non-\\nexperts. The experts were by definition a lot better at that task, but ex-\\ncept for that difference, the two subsets on average turned out to show \\nno significant differences in several ways that you might expect to mat-\\nter: years of experience at the track, years of formal education, occupa-\\ntional prestige scores, and IQ. The IQ averages and variabilities of both \\ngroups, in addition to being the same, were almost exactly the same as \\nfor the overall population. The expert forecasters were no smarter than \\nthe nonexperts or than people in general. \\nLooking at the data more closely, the researchers found that know-\\ning a particular subject\\'s IQ was of no use in predicting whether he was \\na handicapping expert. For example, one of the experts was a construc-\\ntion worker with an IQ of 85 (what one of the early IQ test developers \\nclassified as \"dull normal\") who had been going to the track regularly \\nfor sixteen years; he picked the top horse in ten out of ten races the re-\\nsearchers presented and picked the top three horses in correct order \\nfive times out of ten. By contrast, one of the nonexperts was a lawyer \\nwith an IQ of 118 (\"bright normal,\" almost \"superior\") who had been \\ngoing to the track regularly for fifteen years; he picked the top horse in \\nonly three of ten races and the top three in only one of ten. \\nWhat makes these results especially interesting is that accurately \\n43  Talent Is Overrated \\nforecasting odds is highly complex. More than a dozen factors have to \\nbe considered, and they relate to one another in complicated ways. In \\nfact, the researchers found that the expert handicappers used models \\nthat were far more complex than what the nonexperts used, so-called \\nmultiplicative models in which the values of some factors (such as track \\ncondition) altered the importance of others (such as last-race speed). In \\nother words, what the experts were accomplishing was extremely de-\\nmanding. And to repeat, IQ just didn\\'t seem to matter. \"Low-IQ experts \\nalways used more complex models than high-IQ nonexperts,\" the re-\\nsearchers found. Not only did handicapping expertise fail to correlate \\nwith IQ, it didn\\'t even correlate with performance on the arithmetic \\nsubtest of the IQ test. \\nThe researchers\\' conclusion: Their results suggest \"that whatever it \\nis that an IQ test measures, it is not the ability to engage in cognitively \\ncomplex forms of multivariate reasoning.\" That last phrase is not one \\nthat most of us use very often, but it\\'s actually a very good description \\nof what most of us do every day in our working lives, and what the best \\nperformers do extremely well. You just don\\'t have to be especially \\n\"smart,\" as traditionally defined, to do it. \\nSimilar results turn up in a wide range of fields. For example, in chess—\\nanother realm that businesspeople feel is a lot like their own—IQ does \\nnot reliably predict performance. This seems hard to believe, since we \\ngenerally think of chess as an exercise in pure brainpower. Yet research-\\ners have found that some chess grand masters have IQs that are below \\nnormal. It\\'s a similar story with Go, the Japanese game that is at least \\nas complex as chess. Also surprising, some top Scrabble players score \\nbelow average on tests of verbal ability. \\nEven when performance does match up with IQ in a way we would \\nexpect, the effect tends to be short-lived. That is, even if high-IQ people \\ndo better than low-IQ people when first trying a task that\\'s new to them, \\nthe relationship tends to get weaker and may eventually disappear corn- \\n44  How Smart Do You Have to Be? \\npletely as they work at the task and get better at it. For example, a study \\nof children who took up chess found that the strength of IQ as a predic-\\ntor dropped drastically as the children worked and got better, and IQ \\nwas of no value in predicting how quickly they would improve. Many \\nstudies of adults in the workplace have shown the same pattern. IQ is \\na decent predictor of performance on an unfamiliar task, but once a \\nperson has been at a job for a few years, IQ predicts little or nothing \\nabout performance. \\nNone of this suggests there\\'s anything the least bit wrong with being \\nsmart if you want to succeed in business or anything else. Many of the \\nmost successful people do seem to be highly intelligent. But what the \\nresearch suggests very strongly is that the link between intelligence and \\nhigh achievement isn\\'t nearly as powerful as we commonly suppose. \\nMost important, the research tells us that intelligence as we usually think \\nof it—a high IQ—is not a prerequisite to extraordinary achievement. \\nHow\\'s Your Memory? \\nThe evidence is similar when it comes to that other general ability we \\noften associate with hypersuccessful people, an amazing memory. Fran-\\ncis Galton was certain that this was one of those \"natural gifts\" that \\ncharacterize \"illustrious men\" and that you either inherit it or you don\\'t. \\nFor example: \"[Richard] Porson, the Greek scholar, was remarkable for \\nthis gift, and, I may add, the Porson memory\\' was hereditary in that \\nfamily.\" Yet a large mass of more recent evidence shows that memory \\nability is acquired, and it can be acquired by pretty much anyone. \\nRecall SF, who developed truly remarkable memory ability though \\nhe started with only average memory (and average IQ). He did it by \\nworking out his own mnemonic system based on his experience as a \\ncompetitive runner. For example, recall his struggle to remember the \\nfinal digits of his twenty-two-digit span. He kept saying, \"Nine-forty-six-\\npoint .. nine-forty-six-point... \"Why was he saying \"point\"? (And you \\n45  Talent Is Overrated \\nmay have noticed that he also said it earlier in the sequence, \"Four-\\nthirteen-point-one.\") It\\'s because when he heard the digits 9 4 6 2, he \\nthought of it as 9 minutes, 46.2 seconds, an excellent time for running \\ntwo miles. Similarly, 4 1 3 1 became 4:13.1, a mile time. This is what  \\nresearchers call a retrieval structure, which has particular significance \\nthat we\\'ll hear more about later. Many other studies since SF have \\nconfirmed that apparently average people can achieve extraordinary \\nmemory ability by developing their own retrieval structures or being \\ngiven them by researchers. \\nA different type of research reinforces the finding that memory is \\ndeveloped, not innate. World-class chess players, in addition to being \\nconsidered awesomely smart, are generally assumed to have superhu-\\nman memories, and with good reason. Champions routinely put on \\nexhibitions in which they play lesser opponents while blindfolded; they \\nhold the entire chessboard in their heads. Some of these exhibitions \\nstrike the rest of us as simply beyond belief. The Czech master Richard \\nReti once played twenty-nine blindfolded games simultaneously. (Af-\\nterward he left his briefcase at the exhibition site and commented on \\nwhat a poor memory he had.) Miguel Najdorf, a Polish-Argentinean \\ngrand master, played forty-five blindfolded games simultaneously in \\nSao Paulo in 1947; he won thirty-nine, drew four, and lost two. \\nIt\\'s hard to believe that any normal person could do such things. But \\nconsider a study in which highly skilled chess players as well as non-\\nplayers were shown chessboards with twenty to twenty-five pieces set \\nup as they were in actual games; the research subjects were shown the \\nboards only briefly—five to ten seconds—and then asked to recall the \\npositions of the pieces. The results were what you\\'d expect: The chess \\nmasters could typically recall the position of every piece, while the non-\\nplayers could place only four or five pieces. Then the researchers re-\\npeated the procedure, this time with pieces positioned not as in actual \\ngames but randomly. The nonplayers again could place only four or five \\n46  How Smart Do You Have to Be? \\npieces. But the masters, who had been studying chessboards for most \\nof their lives, did scarcely better, placing only six or seven pieces. \\nThe chess masters did not have incredible memories. What they had \\nwas an incredible ability to remember real chess positions. \\nThis research has been repeated with players of Go, Gomoku (a game \\nplayed with the same board and pieces as Go, but with a different ob-\\njective), and bridge, and the results are the same. Expert players have \\nvastly superior abilities to remember real game positions, or in bridge, \\nhands arranged in the usual order. But when the boards or hands are \\nmixed up, the experts\\' memories are just ordinary. Similarly, SF\\'s in-\\ncredible memory did not extend beyond the specific task he had prac-\\nticed. When he was read lists of random consonants instead of random \\ndigits, his memory was no better than yours or mine. \\nIn short, the widespread view that highly accomplished people have \\ntremendous memories is in one sense justified—they often astound us \\nwith what they can remember. But the view that their amazing ability \\nis a rare natural gift is not justified. Remarkable memory ability is ap-\\nparently available to anyone. \\nIt may seem surprising that off-the-charts general abilities, especially \\nintelligence and memory, are not necessary for extraordinary achieve-\\nment, but it becomes less surprising when we consider the qualities \\nthat highly successful companies and business leaders look for in \\nemployees, or rather what they don\\'t look for. It\\'s certainly true that \\nMcKinsey, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, Google, and other top companies \\nare looking explicitly for brainiacs above all. But it\\'s striking to notice \\nthe companies that don\\'t put extreme cognitive abilities at the top of \\nthe list, or sometimes even on the list. \\nExhibit A would be the company that corporate headhunters con-\\nsistently rank number i as their hunting ground for business lead-\\ners, General Electric. CEO Jeff Immelt has been clear about what the \\n47  Talent Is Overrated \\ncompany is looking for: someone who is externally focused, is a clear \\nthinker, has imagination, is an inclusive leader, and is a confident ex-\\npert. Those are behaviors, not traits, and an IQ of 13 0 is not required \\nin order to exhibit them. Immelt\\'s predecessor, Welch, used a different \\nset of criteria that also was not cognitively focused. He was looking for \\nfour E\\'s: energy, ability to energize, edge (which means decisiveness, but \\nhe needed a word that started with e) , and ability to execute. Again, those \\nare behaviors, and they don\\'t require special intelligence, memory, or \\nmore specific traits. It must be said that many GE leaders do seem aw-\\nfully smart, but, then, those chess masters seem to have astonishing \\nmemories, when what they really have is a little different. So without \\ntesting, it\\'s hard to know exactly what we\\'re seeing. It\\'s notable how \\nmany GE leaders—as distinct from those at McKinsey, Goldman, et al.—\\ndid not go to elite universities. \\nMore generally, many top-performing companies have worked hard \\nto develop hiring criteria and have come up with lists that clearly work \\nbut do not include standout general abilities. Southwest Airlines, the \\nonly airline in America to have made a profit every year for the past \\nthirty-six years, is famous for seeking a blend of attitudes and person-\\nality traits —sense of humor, sense of mission, energy, confidence. \\nThe message from these companies raises an important question: \\nEven if superior intelligence and memory aren\\'t the critical factors for \\nsuccess, are the traits these companies seek—team orientation, humor, \\nconfidence, and so on—reliably related to success across companies, \\nand if so, are they innate traits that you either have or you don\\'t? Re-\\nsearch suggests that some personality dimensions do match up with \\nsuccess at certain types of work; yes, salespeople tend to be more ex-\\ntroverted, for example. \\nLogical next question: Are you stuck with the personality traits you \\nhave? Research going back decades suggests that personality dimen-\\nsions don\\'t vary much over the course of a person\\'s life. But of course \\nthat doesn\\'t necessarily limit a person\\'s achievement; it may limit only \\n48  How Smart Do You Have to Be? \\nthe fields in which a person is most likely to excel. In addition, even \\nwithin a given field, we know that some of the most successful people \\nin business changed their personalities in significant ways. Former Trea-\\nsury Secretary Robert Rubin, who spent most of his career at Goldman \\nSachs and became the firm\\'s cochief, reports that in his early years at \\nGoldman he was, essentially, a jerk. He admits that he was \"short with \\npeople,\" \"impersonal,\" \"abrupt and peremptory,\" and frequently not nice \\nto colleagues. None of this hindered his career as a successful arbitra-\\ngeur; no one much cared how traders behaved as long as they delivered \\nresults. But then one day an older partner told Rubin he could possibly \\nplay a larger role in the firm if he changed his ways and actually started \\nto care about the people he worked with. As Rubin recalls in his mem-\\noir, \"I\\'ve often asked myself why this advice affected me so much.\" He \\nspeculates on reasons, but the bottom line is that it affected him deeply. \\nHe started listening to people better, understanding their problems, and \\nvaluing their views. He changed an important element of his personal-\\nity. If he hadn\\'t, it\\'s unlikely he would have become one of the most re-\\nspected and admired figures at Goldman and on Wall Street. \\nPsychologists might argue that people who do what Rubin did aren\\'t \\nchanging their personalities, they\\'re changing their behavior in order \\nto override some part of their personalities. Fine; there\\'s no need to \\nquibble. What matters is that they were not constrained by particular \\ntraits. \\nAt this point you can\\'t help but wonder if there\\'s anything at all (a) that \\nmakes a significant difference to whether you achieve extraordinary \\nperformance, and (b) that you can\\'t do anything about. The answer is \\nyes, of course there is. Most obvious are congenital physical and mental \\nhealth problems, plus other diseases and disorders that may visit any \\nof us at any time for reasons we still don\\'t fully understand. Those con-\\nstraints aside, and considering only people in general good health, the \\nclearly innate limitations seem to be physical. Once you\\'ve matured \\n49  Talent Is Overrated \\nphysically, you can\\'t do much about your height, and if you\\'re five feet \\ntall you\\'re just never going to be an NFL lineman, while if you\\'re seven \\nfeet tall you will not be an Olympic gymnast. Overall body size is also \\npartly innate, so champion sumo wrestlers can probably never make \\nthemselves into elite marathoners. While you can develop your voice \\nin all kinds of ways, the dimensions of your vocal cords impose limits; \\na tenor cannot make himself into a basso profundo. \\nThat is all widely agreed upon. What\\'s surprising is that when it \\ncomes to innate, unalterable limits on what healthy adults can achieve, \\nanything beyond those physical constraints is in dispute. Clear evidence \\nthat such nonphysical constraints exist has not been found so far. \\nThat fact is profoundly opposed to what most of us believe. We tend \\nto think we are forever barred from all manner of successes because of \\nwhat we were or were not born with. The range of cases in which that \\nbelief is true turns out to be a great deal narrower than most of us think. \\nThe roadblocks we face seem to be mostly imaginary. \\nThis finding alone, however, is frustrating. We may have determined \\nthat there are hardly any immutable factors that prevent us from ever \\nplaying a work more difficult than \"Chopsticks\" on the piano, or from \\ndoing word problems in math, or from leading an organization larger \\nthan a softball team. But what we\\'d really like to know is not what does \\nor doesn\\'t stop us, but what makes some people go so much further \\nthan others. And what we have discovered so far is not what makes \\nsome people excel but rather what doesn\\'t. Specifically: \\n• It isn\\'t experience. Not only are we surrounded by highly experi-\\nenced people who are nowhere near great at what they do, but we have \\nalso seen evidence that some people in a wide range of fields actually \\nget worse after years of doing something. \\n• It isn\\'t specific inborn abilities. We\\'ve seen extensive evidence \\nthat calls into question whether such abilities exist, and even if cer-\\ntain types of them might, they clearly do not determine excellence. \\n50  How Smart Do You Have to Be? \\nPeople who seem to possess abilities of this type do not necessarily \\nachieve high performance, and we\\'ve seen many examples of people \\nshowing no evidence of such abilities who have produced extraordinary \\nachievement. \\n• It isn\\'t general abilities such as intelligence and memory. The re-\\nsearch finds that in many fields the relation between intelligence and \\nperformance is weak or nonexistent; people with modest IQs some-\\ntimes perform outstandingly while people with high IQs sometimes \\ndon\\'t get past mediocrity. Memory seems clearly to be acquired. \\nIn short, we\\'ve nailed down what doesn\\'t drive great performance. \\nSo what does? \\n51  Chapter Four \\nA Better Idea \\nAn explanation of great performance \\nthat makes sense \\nGrowing up in Crawford, Mississippi (population: 636), Jerry Rice had \\nto be talked into joining his high school\\'s football team. The coach had \\nreportedly heard that the young man was fast and persuaded him to \\ntry out. Rice played well and was named to the All-State team, but not \\nso well that any big-name college would offer him a scholarship. Even-\\ntually Mississippi Valley State University in Itta Bena, Mississippi (popu-\\nlation: 1,946), did offer him a football scholarship, and that\\'s where he \\nspent the next four years. \\nRice was a big star at the little school, setting many NCAA records \\nas a receiver. In his senior season he was named to every All-America \\nteam and was even a long-shot candidate for the Heisman Trophy (he \\ndidn\\'t win). Again, however, he was not so extraordinary that NFL \\nteams were fighting one another to get him. The problem was his speed; \\nwhile he was fast by the standards of Crawford, and he was fast enough \\nto be a college star, in the NFL his speed was nothing special. In the \\n1985 draft, fifteen teams passed him over before the San Francisco \\n49ers finally signed him. \\nAs every football fan knows, Jerry Rice was the greatest receiver in \\nNFL history, and some football authorities believe he may have been \\nthe greatest player at any position. His utter dominance is hard to be-\\nlieve in a league where the competition is so intense and conducted at \\nsuch a high level. For example, the records he holds for total receptions, \\n52  A Better Idea \\ntotal touchdown receptions, and total receiving yards are greater than \\nthe second-place totals not by 5 percent or 10 percent, which would be \\nimpressive, but by about 5o percent. \\nIt\\'s always dangerous to suggest that any record will never be bro-\\nken, but breaking Rice\\'s records will be a particular challenge because \\nhe was an iron man. He played twenty seasons at a position that is no-\\ntoriously perilous, and he played in almost every game of every season \\nexcept one, 1997, when he was out for fourteen weeks because of an \\ninjury and returned sooner than his doctors advised. For some future \\nplayer to perform at such an extremely high standard for so many years \\nin a physically brutal game is obviously not impossible, but history sug-\\ngests that it is unlikely. \\nWhat Made Rice So Good? \\nWith regard to most players, that kind of question usually guarantees \\nan argument among sports fans, but in Rice\\'s case the answer is com-\\npletely noncontroversial. Everyone in the football world seems to agree \\nthat Rice was the greatest because he worked harder in practice and in \\nthe off-season than anyone else. \\nIn team workouts he was famous for his hustle; while many receiv-\\ners will trot back to the quarterback after catching a pass, Rice would \\nsprint to the end zone after each reception. He would typically continue \\npracticing long after the rest of the team had gone home. Most remark-\\nable were his six-days-a-week off-season workouts, which he conducted \\nentirely on his own. Mornings were devoted to cardiovascular work, \\nrunning a hilly five-mile trail; he would reportedly run ten forty-meter \\nwind sprints up the steepest part. In the afternoons he did equally \\nstrenuous weight training. These workouts became legendary as the \\nmost demanding in the league, and other players would sometimes join \\nRice just to see what it was like. Some of them got sick before the day \\nwas over. \\n53  Talent Is Overrated \\nOccasionally someone would write to the 49ers\\' trainer asking for the \\ndetails of Rice\\'s workout, but the trainer never released the information \\nout of fear that people would hurt themselves trying to duplicate it. \\nThe lesson that\\'s easiest to draw from Jerry Rice\\'s story is that hard \\nwork makes all the difference. Yet we know—from research and from \\njust looking around us—that hard work often doesn\\'t lead to extraor-\\ndinary performance. We also know that even after an excellent college \\ncareer, Rice did not possess outstanding speed, a quality that coaches \\ngenerally consider mandatory in a great receiver. So there must be \\nsomething else lurking in Rice\\'s story. \\nThere is. Note several relevant points: \\nHe spent very little time playing football. \\nOf all the work Rice did to make himself a great player, practically none \\nof it was playing football games. His independent off-season workouts \\nconsisted of conditioning, and his team workouts were classroom study, \\nreviewing of game films, conditioning, and lots of work with other play-\\ners on specific plays. But the 49ers and eventually the other teams for \\nwhich Rice played almost never ran full-contact scrimmages because \\nthey didn\\'t want to risk injuring players. That means that of the total \\ntime Rice spent actually playing the game for which he became famous, \\nnearly all of it was in the weekly games themselves. \\nHow large a part of his football-related work was that? Let\\'s estimate \\nvery conservatively that over the course of a year, Rice averaged 20 \\nhours a week working on football; the work is demanding and even the \\nmost dedicated player can sustain only a limited amount. There is evi-\\ndence that Rice probably averaged much more than that, but let\\'s play \\nit safe. That\\'s about 1,000 hours a year, or 20,000 hours over his pro \\ncareer. He played 303 career NFL games—the most ever by a wide \\nreceiver—and if we assume the offense had the ball half the time on \\naverage, that\\'s about 15o hours of playing time as measured by the \\n54  A Better Idea \\ngame clock; this may be overstated, since Rice wasn\\'t on the field for \\nevery play. The conclusion we reach is that one of the greatest-ever \\nfootball players devoted less than ). percent of his football-related work \\nto playing games. \\nOf course it\\'s true that all NFL players devote most of their work-\\nrelated time to nongame activities, and that fact is significant. These \\npeople, doing their work at its highest level and subject to continuous, \\nunsparing evaluation, don\\'t set up weekday football games for practice; \\nthey spend almost all their time on other activities, a fact that we should \\nremember. In the case of Rice, one of the greatest players, the ratio was \\neven more extreme. \\nHe designed his practice to work on his specific needs. \\nRice didn\\'t need to do everything well, just certain things. He had to \\nrun precise patterns; he had to evade the defenders, sometimes two or \\nthree, who were assigned to cover him; he had to outjump them to catch \\nthe ball and outmuscle them when they tried to strip it away; then he \\nhad to outrun tacklers. So he focused his practice work on exactly those \\nrequirements. Not being the fastest receiver in the league turned out \\nnot to matter. He became famous for the precision of his patterns. His \\nweight training gave him tremendous strength. His trail running gave \\nhim control so he could change directions suddenly without signaling \\nhis move. The uphill wind sprints game him explosive acceleration. Most \\nof all, his endurance training—not something that a speed-focused \\nathlete would normally concentrate on—gave him a giant advantage \\nin the fourth quarter, when his opponents were tired and weak, and he \\nseemed as fresh as he was in the first minute. Time and again, that\\'s \\nwhen he put the game away. \\nRice and his coaches understood exactly what he needed in order to \\nbe dominant. They focused on those things and not on other goals that \\nmight have seemed generally desirable, like speed. \\n55  Talent Is Overrated \\nWhile supported by others, he did much of the work on his own. \\nThe football season lasts less than half the year. A team sport obviously \\nrequires that the players work together a great deal, yet most of Rice\\'s \\nwork was in the off-season. He had the important advice of coaches and \\ntrainers, but he did most of his football-related work by himself. \\nIt wasn\\'t fun. \\nThere\\'s nothing enjoyable about running to the point of exhaustion or \\nlifting weights to the point of muscle failure. But these were centrally \\nimportant activities. \\nHe defied the conventional limits of age. \\nThe average NFL player leaves the league in his twenties; playing at \\nage thirty-five is an unusual achievement. The widely accepted view is \\nthat even if a player avoids injury, deterioration of the body is inevita-\\nble, and a player in his late thirties can no longer prevail when facing \\nan opponent fifteen years younger. The few players who have remained \\nstarters into their forties have overwhelmingly been quarterbacks, who \\ndon\\'t block and don\\'t run much on most plays, or kickers and punters, \\nwho are in for only a few plays per game and are rarely even touched \\nby the opponents. Wide receivers, who run like hell on most plays and \\nfrequently get crushed by tacklers, aren\\'t supposed to last twenty sea-\\nsons or play until age forty-two. None but Rice has ever done so. \\nThe Crucial Finding \\nIt\\'s natural to question how much relevance a football star\\'s career \\nmight have for the rest of us, and besides, it\\'s just one person\\'s story. \\nFrom a scientific perspective it\\'s an anecdote, not data. To see whether \\nthe apparent lessons of Rice\\'s career might apply more broadly, con- \\n56  A Better Idea \\nsider a critically important and highly rigorous scientific study con-\\nducted in the early nineties in a very different place, Berlin, and \\nexamining a very different realm, music. \\nThe object of the study was to figure out why some violinists are \\nbetter than others. The researchers went to the Music Academy of West \\nBerlin, as it was then known, a postsecondary school that turns out ex-\\ntremely good musicians, many of whom go on to careers with major \\nsymphony orchestras or as solo performers. Professors were asked to \\nnominate the very best violinists, those with the potential for careers \\nas international soloists. The professors also nominated violinists who \\nwere very good but not as good as the top group. In addition, the acad-\\nemy had a separate department with lower admission standards, the \\nstudents of which generally go on to become music teachers, and the \\nresearchers recruited a group from this department as well. That made \\nthree groups of test subjects—we\\'ll call them good, better, and best—\\nwhich the researchers chose to be as similar as possible in age (all stu-\\ndents were in their early twenties) and sex. \\nThe researchers then collected lots of biographical data about all the \\nsubjects—the age at which they started studying music, the teachers \\nthey had, the competitions they had entered, and much else. The data \\nconfirmed the judgments of the music professors: The best violinists \\nhad been more successful in competitions than the better ones, who had \\nbeen more successful than the good ones. The subjects were asked to \\nestimate how many hours a week they practiced for each year since \\nthey started. They were given a long list of activities, music-related and \\nnon-music-related, and asked how much time they had spent on each \\none in the most recent typical week; they were also asked to rate how \\nrelevant each activity was to making them better violinists, how effort-\\nful it was, and how enjoyable it was. They were asked a great deal more, \\nincluding how they had spent the previous day, minute by minute, and \\nthey were asked to fill out a detailed diary for a week. Because diary \\n57  Talent Is Overrated \\nreports aren\\'t always accurate, the researchers cross-checked them in \\nvarious ways and conducted extensive interviews with the subjects af-\\nterward to confirm the validity of the numbers. \\nThe result was a vast trove of data. A layman looking at it all would \\nsimply conclude that the lives and behaviors of these violinists had \\nbeen analyzed thirteen ways from Sunday. But as it happened, the re-\\nsults that emerged from all this analysis were particularly clear and \\nstrong. \\nBy many measures, all three groups of violinists were about the \\nsame. They all started studying the violin at around age eight and de-\\ncided to become musicians at around age fifteen, with no statistically \\nsignificant differences among the groups. By the time of the study, \\nevery subject had been studying the violin for at least a decade. \\nPerhaps most striking, all three groups were spending the same total \\namount of time on music-related activities—lessons, practice, classes, \\nand so on—about fifty-one hours a week. The researchers found no \\nstatistically significant differences among the groups on this measure. \\nThat is, all three groups were getting up every morning and putting in \\nthe hours, throwing themselves at their chosen career in a fairly com-\\nmitted way with a demanding workweek equal to what a great many \\npeople clock in a wide range of fields. \\nThe violinists were quite certain which activity was most important \\nfor making them better: It was practicing by themselves. When asked \\nto rate the relevance of twelve music-related activities and ten non-\\nmusic-related activities (such as household chores, shopping, leisure) \\nto their progress, solitary practice was number one with a bullet. \\nThey all knew it, but they didn\\'t all do it. Though the violinists un-\\nderstood the importance of practice alone, the amount of time the vari-\\nous groups actually spent practicing alone differed dramatically. The \\ntwo top groups, the best and better violinists, practiced by themselves \\nabout twenty-four hours a week on average. The third group, the good \\nviolinists, practiced by themselves only nine hours a week. \\n58  A Better Idea \\nThis finding becomes even richer with meaning when we consider \\nother aspects of practice. Just as the violinists were sure that it\\'s the \\nmost important activity, they were also quite clear that it\\'s hard and it \\nisn\\'t much fun. When they rated activities by effort required, solo prac-\\ntice ranked way harder than playing music for fun, alone or with others, \\nand harder than even the most effortful everyday activity, child care. \\nAs for pleasure, practice ranked far below playing for fun and even \\nbelow formal group performance, which you might reasonably guess \\nwould be the most stressful and least fun activity. \\nPractice is so hard that doing a lot of it requires people to arrange \\ntheir lives in particular ways. The two top groups of violinists did most \\nof their practicing in the late morning or early afternoon, when they \\nwere still fairly fresh. By contrast, violinists in the third group practiced \\nmostly in the late afternoon, when they were more likely to be tired. \\nThe two top groups differed from the third group in another way: They \\nslept more. They not only slept more at night, they also took far more \\nafternoon naps. All that practicing seems to demand a lot of recovery. \\nSolo practice is unusual among music-related activities in that it\\'s \\nlargely within the individual\\'s control. Most other activities—taking \\nlessons, attending classes, giving performances—require other people\\'s \\ninvolvement and are therefore constrained. But with i68 hours in a \\nweek, a person can practice by himself or herself just about without \\nlimit. In fact, no one in the study came anywhere near spending every \\navailable hour on practice. \\nSo all the violinists understood that practicing by themselves was \\nthe most important thing they could do to get better. Though they \\ndidn\\'t consider it easy or fun, they all had virtually unlimited time in \\nwhich to do it. On those dimensions, they were all the same. The dif-\\nference was that some chose to practice more, and those violinists were \\na great deal better. \\nThe advantage of practice was cumulative. You may have noticed that \\nat the time of the study, the best and better violinists were practicing \\n59  Talent Is Overrated \\nabout the same amount, twenty-four hours a week. While this was enor-\\nmously more practice than the merely good violinists were doing, the \\nresearchers didn\\'t find a significant difference in practice time between \\nthe two top groups. That lack of difference would seem to pose a prob-\\nlem. If more practice equals better performance, then why isn\\'t the best \\ngroup practicing any more than the middle group? \\nThe answer lies in the students\\' histories. All the research subjects \\nwere asked to estimate their weekly practice hours for each year of their \\nviolin-playing lives, enabling the researchers to calculate cumulative \\nlifetime totals. The results were extraordinarily clear. By age eighteen, \\nthe violinists in the first group had accumulated 7,410 hours of lifetime \\npractice on average, versus 5,301 hours for violinists in the second \\ngroup and 3,420 hours for those in the third group. All the differences \\nwere statistically significant. \\nAgain, the implications are even stronger than they may first appear. \\nYes, more total practice is very powerfully associated with better per-\\nformance. But now imagine the situation of a violinist in the third \\ngroup who decides at age eighteen that he wants to become an inter-\\nnational soloist, the next Itzhak Perlman or Joshua Bell. The hard reality \\nis that the best violinists of his age, the ones he\\'ll have to match or beat, \\nhave already racked up more than twice as much practice time as he \\nhas. If he wants to catch up, he\\'ll have to practice far more than they \\ndo, even though he\\'s currently practicing far less (nine hours a week \\nversus twenty-four). So he\\'ll have to multiply his practice time by a \\nhuge factor if he wants to catch up before he\\'s an old man, and he\\'ll \\nhave to make this all-consuming commitment at just the point in life \\nwhen a person is expected to take on adult responsibilities and start \\nbecoming financially independent. In short, it may be possible in theory \\nfor our young man or woman to vault into the world of elite violin so-\\nloists, but as a practical matter it will be nearly impossible. The issues \\nimplicit in his situation turn out to be highly significant for individuals \\nand organizations generally. \\n6o  A Better Idea \\nThis study was extraordinarily persuasive in answering the question \\nof why some violinists are so much better than others. It was part of a \\nlandmark paper on the larger question of why certain people in any \\nfield—business, sports, music, science, arts—were extremely good \\nwhile most people were not. The lead author of that paper—\"The Role \\nof Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance\"—was \\nAnders Ericsson, the man who fifteen years earlier had helped conduct \\nthe experiment with the screaming undergraduate who could remem-\\nber eighty-two random digits. The implications of that research had \\nnever left Ericsson\\'s mind. Now, in this new paper, he and his coauthors, \\nRalf Th. Krampe and Clemens Tesch-Romer of the Max Planck Institute \\nfor Human Development and Education, were proposing a new theo-\\nretical framework for understanding why some people are so remark-\\nably good at what they do. \\nThey proposed this new framework because the existing one, which \\nrelied heavily on the concept of innate talent, was so clearly unsatisfac-\\ntory. We\\'ve already seen many of the problems with it, such as the nu-\\nmerous cases of great performers who showed no evidence of precocity \\nor natural gifts. In addition to these problems, Ericsson and his coau-\\nthors had noticed another theme that emerged in research on top-level \\nperformers: No matter who they were, or what explanation of their \\nperformance was being advanced, it always took them many years to \\nbecome excellent, and if a person achieves elite status only after many \\nyears of toil, assigning the principal role in that success to innate gifts \\nbecomes problematic, to say the least. \\nThe phenomenon seems nearly universal. In a famous study of chess \\nplayers, Nobel Prize winner Herbert Simon and William Chase (Erics-\\nson\\'s coauthor on the memory study) proposed \"the ten-year rule,\" based \\non their observation that no one seemed to reach the top ranks of chess \\nplayers without a decade or so of intensive study, and some required \\nmuch more time. Even Bobby Fischer was not an exception; when he \\nbecame a grand master at age sixteen, he had been studying chess  Talent Is Overrated \\nintensively for nine years. Subsequent research in a wide range of fields \\nhas substantiated the ten-year rule everywhere the researchers have \\nlooked. In math, science, musical composition, swimming, X-ray diag-\\nnosis, tennis, literature—no one, not even the most \"talented\" perform-\\ners, became great without at least ten years of very hard preparation. \\nIf talent means that success is easy or rapid, as most people seem to \\nbelieve, then something is obviously wrong with a talent-based expla-\\nnation of high achievement. \\nAs researchers went further down this road, they noticed something \\nelse: Many scientists and authors produce their greatest work only after \\ntwenty or more years of devoted effort, which means that in year nine-\\nteen they are still getting better. That fact posed additional problems \\nfor the talent-based view of exceptional achievement. Francis Galton \\nwas absolutely convinced that every person is born with various limits \\nthat he simply cannot get past: \"His maximum performance becomes \\na rigidly determinate quantity.\" Those limits apply to every kind of en-\\ndeavor, physical or mental. A person bumps up against his or her limits \\nfairly early in life, Galton believed, and after that, \"unless he is incur-\\nably blinded by self-conceit, he learns precisely of what performance \\nhe is capable, and what other enterprises lie beyond his compass.\" At \\nthat sobering moment, Galton said, the wise person literally gives up \\ntrying to do more. \"He is no longer tormented into hopeless efforts by \\nthe fallacious promptings of overweening vanity. . .\" He discards the \\nfoolish notion that he can ever do better, makes peace with the idea that \\nhe\\'s as good as he\\'ll ever be, and \"finds true moral repose in an honest \\nconviction that he is engaged in as much good work as his nature has \\nrendered him capable of performing.\" At least Galton made it sound \\nnoble. \\nYet a hundred years later, abundant evidence showed clearly that \\npeople can keep getting better long after they should have reached their \\n\"rigidly determinate\" natural limits. The examples were not just great \\n62  A Better Idea \\nwriters, artists, businesspeople, inventors, and other eminences produc-\\ning their best work three or four decades into their careers. By the late \\nnineteenth century, scientific research was showing repeatedly that \\nordinary people in various lines of work could keep getting better \\neven after their performance had apparently plateaued. Typists, tele-\\ngraph operators, typesetters—highly experienced workers in all these \\njobs, whose performance hadn\\'t improved in years, suddenly got mark-\\nedly better when they were offered incentives or given new kinds of \\ntraining. This evidence was obviously a big problem for the you\\'ve-got-\\nit-or-you-don\\'t view of achievement. \\nSumming up the extensive evidence, Ericsson and his coauthors \\nobserved that \"the search for stable heritable characteristics that could \\npredict or at least account for the superior performance of eminent in-\\ndividuals has been surprisingly unsuccessful.\" Yet at the time of their \\narticle, the talent-based view of high achievement was still the explana-\\ntion most widely favored. Why? The authors offered a simple reason: \\n\"The conviction in the importance of talent appears to be based on the \\ninsufficiency of alternative hypotheses to explain the exceptional na-\\nture of expert performers.\" \\nThat is, no one had a better idea. So here was their better idea. \\nIt could be put very simply: What the authors called \"deliberate prac-\\ntice\" makes all the difference. Or as they stated it with stark clarity in \\ntheir scholarly paper, \"the differences between expert performers and \\nnormal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve \\nperformance in a specific domain.\" \\nThis position was highly significant for two reasons. First, it ex-\\nplicitly rejected the you\\'ve-got-it-or-you-don\\'t view. It explained high \\nachievement without the concept of talent playing any role. The authors \\naccepted that the great performers in any field really are qualitatively \\ndifferent from the rest of us but disputed the common view of where \\nthose differences come from. As they stated, \"we deny that these \\n63  Talent Is Overrated \\ndifferences are immutable, that is, due to innate talent.\" So here was a \\nfundamentally new view of why some people are so extremely good at \\nwhat they do. \\nThe second reason why Ericsson et al.\\'s new framework was signifi-\\ncant is that it resolved the huge contradiction in the body of scholarly \\nresearch on performance and high achievement as well as in our every-\\nday experience. On the one hand, we see everywhere that years of hard \\nwork do not make most people great at what they do. If all we did was \\nopen our eyes and look around, we would probably agree with Galton: \\nThe vast majority of people we work with, or play golf with, or play \\nDoom with, got better for a while and then leveled off, having appar-\\nently reached the limit of their abilities; years of further work have not \\nmade them any better. On the other hand, we see repeatedly that the \\npeople who have achieved the most are the ones who have worked \\nthe hardest. How can both sets of observations be true? \\nThe framework advanced by Ericsson and his colleagues goes to the \\nheart of this contradiction. The problem, they observed, is that \"the cur-\\nrent definition of practice is vague.\" Their framework is not based on a \\nsimplistic \"practice makes perfect\" observation. Rather, it is based on \\ntheir highly specific concept of \"deliberate practice.\" \\nPrecisely what this means turns out to be critically important. It does \\nnot mean what most people think it does. An understanding of it illu-\\nminates the path to high achievement in any field, not just by individu-\\nals but also by teams and organizations. And by the way, it shows, \\namong many other things, that Jerry Rice knew exactly what he was \\ndoing. \\n64  Chapter Five \\nWhat Deliberate Practice Is and Isn\\'t \\nFor starters, it isn\\'t what most of us do \\nwhen we\\'re \"practicing.\" \\nWe all know what practice is. I do it all the time. Odds are good that \\nyou do it in a similar general way, regardless of what you\\'re practicing. \\nWhen I practice golf, I go to the driving range and get two big buckets \\nof balls. I pick my spot, put down my bag of clubs, and tip over one of \\nthe buckets. I read somewhere that you should warm up with short \\nirons, so I take out an 8- or 9-iron and start hitting. I also read some-\\nwhere that you should always have a target, so I pick one of the fake \\n\"greens\" out on the range and aim for it, though I\\'m not really sure how \\nfar away it is. As I work through the short irons, middle irons, long \\nirons, and driver, I hit quite a few bad shots. My usual reaction is to hit \\nanother ball as quickly as possible in hopes that it will be a decent shot, \\nand then I can forget about the bad one. \\nOccasionally I realize that I should stop to think about why the shot \\nwas bad. There seem to be about five thousand things you can do wrong \\nwhen hitting a golf ball, so I pick one of them and work on it a bit, con-\\nvincing myself that I can sense improvement, until I hit another bad \\none, at which point I figure I should probably also work on another \\none of the five thousand things. Not long thereafter the two buckets of \\nballs are gone and I head back to the clubhouse, very much looking for-\\nward to playing an actual game of golf, and feeling virtuous for having \\npracticed. \\n65  Talent Is Overrated \\nBut in truth I have no justification for feeling virtuous. Whatever it \\nwas I was doing out on the range, and regardless of whether I call it \\npractice, it hasn\\'t accomplished a thing. \\nThe Elements \\nThe concept of deliberate practice, advanced by Anders Ericsson and \\nhis colleagues and since investigated by many other researchers, is \\nquite specific. It isn\\'t work and isn\\'t play, but is something entirely unto \\nitself. We commonly use the term \"practice\" when talking about two \\ndomains, sports and music, but that habit can lead us astray. As already \\nsuggested, what we think of as practice frequently isn\\'t what the re-\\nsearchers mean by deliberate practice. Just as important, our habitual \\nuse of the term in sports and music may stop us from thinking of how \\ndeliberate practice can be applied in other domains, such as business \\nor science, in which we almost never think about practicing. Examples \\nfrom sports and music are highly instructional because they\\'re familiar, \\nbut I\\'ll explain in chapters 7, 8, and 9 how the same principles can be \\nmuch more widely applied. Since this activity is the essence of great \\nperformance, we have much to gain by banishing preconceptions and \\nopening our minds to what it really is. \\nDeliberate practice is characterized by several elements, each worth \\nexamining. It is activity designed specifically to improve performance, \\noften with a teacher\\'s help; it can be repeated a lot; feedback on results \\nis continuously available; it\\'s highly demanding mentally, whether the \\nactivity is purely intellectual, such as chess or business-related activi-\\nties, or heavily physical, such as sports; and it isn\\'t much fun. \\nLet\\'s consider each of those attributes of deliberate practice and what \\nit implies. \\n66  What Deliberate Practice Is and Isn\\'t \\nIt\\'s designed specifically to improve performance. \\nThe key word in this attribute is designed. In the example of my pa-\\nthetic routine on the driving range, I was designing my own practice \\nactivity, even though it\\'s clear that I\\'m completely unqualified to do so. \\nThe mechanics of hitting golf balls have been studied for decades and \\nare extremely well understood by those who have made it their profes-\\nsion, but I have virtually none of their knowledge. It\\'s the same in al-\\nmost every field: Decades or centuries of study have produced a body \\nof knowledge about how performance is developed and improved, and \\nfull-time teachers generally possess that knowledge. At least in the early \\ngoing, therefore, and sometimes long after, it\\'s almost always necessary \\nfor a teacher to design the activity best suited to improve an individual\\'s \\nperformance. In some fields, especially intellectual ones such as the \\narts, science, and business, people may eventually become skilled enough \\nto design their own practice. But anyone who thinks they\\'ve outgrown \\nthe benefits of a teacher\\'s help should at least question that view. There\\'s \\na reason why the world\\'s best golfers still go to teachers. \\nOne of those reasons goes beyond the teacher\\'s knowledge. It\\'s his \\nor her ability to see you in ways that you cannot see yourself. In sports \\nthe observation is literal; I cannot see myself hitting the golf ball and \\nwould benefit greatly from someone else\\'s perspective. In other fields \\nthe observation may be metaphorical. A chess teacher is looking at the \\nsame boards as the student but can see that the student is consistently \\noverlooking an important threat. A business coach is looking at the \\nsame situations as a manager but can see, for example, that the man-\\nager systematically fails to communicate his intentions clearly. \\nIt\\'s apparent why becoming significantly good at almost anything is \\nextremely difficult without the help of a teacher or coach, at least in the \\nearly going. Without a clear, unbiased view of the subject\\'s perfor-\\nmance, choosing the best practice activity will be impossible; for rea-\\nsons that may be simply physical (as in sports) or deeply psychological, \\n67  Talent Is Overrated \\nvery few of us can make a clear, honest assessment of our own perfor-\\nmance. Even if we could, we could not design the best practice activity \\nfor that moment in our development—the type of practice that would \\nput us on the road to achieving at the highest levels—unless we had \\nextensive knowledge of the latest and best methods for developing \\npeople in our chosen field. Most of us don\\'t have that knowledge. \\nWhile the best methods of development are constantly changing, \\nthey\\'re always built around a central principle: They\\'re meant to stretch \\nthe individual beyond his or her current abilities. That may sound ob-\\nvious, but most of us don\\'t do it in the activities we think of as practice. \\nAt the driving range or at the piano, most of us, as adults, are just doing \\nwhat we\\'ve done before and hoping to maintain the level of perfor-\\nmance that we probably reached long ago. \\nBy contrast, deliberate practice requires that one identify certain \\nsharply defined elements of performance that need to be improved, \\nand then work intently on them. Examples are everywhere. The great \\nsoprano Joan Sutherland devoted countless hours to practicing her \\ntrill—and not just the basic trill, but the many different types (whole-\\ntone, semitone, baroque). Tiger Woods has been seen to drop golf balls \\ninto a sand trap and step on them, then practice shots from that near-\\nimpossible lie. The great performers isolate remarkably specific aspects \\nof what they do and focus on just those things until they are improved; \\nthen it\\'s on to the next aspect. \\nChoosing these aspects of performance is itself an important skill. \\nNoel Tichy, a professor at the University of Michigan business school \\nand former chief of General Electric\\'s famous Crotonville management \\ndevelopment center, illustrates the point by drawing three concentric \\ncircles. He labels the inner circle \"comfort zone,\" the middle one \"learn-\\ning zone,\" and the outer one \"panic zone.\" Only by choosing activities \\nin the learning zone can one make progress. That\\'s the location of skills \\nand abilities that are just out of reach. We can never make progress in \\nthe comfort zone because those are the activities we can already do eas- \\n68  What Deliberate Practice Is and Isn\\'t \\nily, while panic-zone activities are so hard that we don\\'t even know how \\nto approach them. \\nIdentifying the learning zone, which is not simple, and then forcing \\noneself to stay continually in it as it changes, which is even harder—\\nthese are the first and most important characteristics of deliberate \\npractice. \\nIt can be repeated a lot. \\nHigh repetition is the most important difference between deliberate \\npractice of a task and performing the task for real, when it counts. Tiger \\nWoods may face that buried lie in the sand only two or three times in \\na season, and if those were his only opportunities to work on hitting \\nthat shot, he certainly wouldn\\'t be able to hit it very well. \\nRepeating a specific activity over and over is what most of us mean \\nby practice, yet for most of us it isn\\'t especially effective. After all, I was \\nrepeating something—hitting golf balls—on the driving range. Two \\npoints distinguish deliberate practice from what most of us actually do. \\nOne is the choice of a properly demanding activity in the learning zone, \\nas discussed. My golf practice certainly failed on that criterion, since I \\nwasn\\'t focused on doing anything in particular. The other is the amount \\nof repetition. Top performers repeat their practice activities to stultify-\\ning extent. Ted Williams, baseball\\'s greatest hitter, would practice hit-\\nting until his hands bled. Pete Maravich, whose college basketball \\nrecords still stand after more than thirty years, would go to the gym \\nwhen it opened in the morning and shoot baskets until it closed at \\nnight. An extreme and instructive example is the golfer Moe Norman, \\nwho played from the 195 0s to the 1970s and never amounted to much \\non the pro tour because, for reasons of his own, he was never very in-\\nterested in winning tournaments. He was just interested in hitting \\ngolf balls consistently well, and at this he may have been the greatest \\never. Shot after shot was straight and just like the one before it. His \\npractice routine from age sixteen to age thirty-two involved hitting \\n69  Talent Is Overrated \\neight hundred balls a day, five days a week. He was (perhaps obviously) \\nobsessive about this and claimed to have kept count of all the practice \\nballs he ever hit; by the mid-199 0s he was up to four million. Top-level \\npro golf requires much more than just hitting straight shots, but at this \\nparticular skill, mind-boggling repetition produced amazing ability. \\nMore generally, the most effective deliberate practice activities are \\nthose that can be repeated at high volume. \\nFeedback on results is continuously available. \\nSteve Kerr, former chief learning officer of Goldman Sachs and a highly \\nrespected researcher on leadership development, says that practicing \\nwithout feedback is like bowling through a curtain that hangs down to \\nknee level. You can work on technique all you like, but if you can\\'t see \\nthe effects, two things will happen: You won\\'t get any better, and you\\'ll \\nstop caring. \\nGetting feedback on most practice activities is easy. Lift the curtain \\nand a bowler knows immediately how he did; in sports generally, see-\\ning the results of practice is no problem. Aspiring chess masters prac-\\ntice by studying chess games played by the greatest players; at each \\nposition, the student chooses a move and then gets feedback by seeing \\nwhat the champion did. Difficulties arise when the results require in-\\nterpretation. You may believe you played that bar of the Brahms Violin \\nConcerto perfectly, but can you really trust your own judgment? Or you \\nmay think that your rehearsal of a job interview was flawless, but your \\nopinion isn\\'t what counts. These are situations in which a teacher, \\ncoach, or mentor is vital for providing crucial feedback. \\nIt\\'s highly demanding mentally. \\nDeliberate practice is above all an effort of focus and concentration. \\nThat is what makes it \"deliberate,\" as distinct from the mindless play-\\ning of scales or hitting of tennis balls that most people engage in. \\nContinually seeking exactly those elements of performance that are \\n70  What Deliberate Practice Is and Isn\\'t \\nunsatisfactory and then trying one\\'s hardest to make them better places \\nenormous strains on anyone\\'s mental abilities. \\nThe work is so great that it seems no one can sustain it for very long. \\nA finding that is remarkably consistent across disciplines is that four \\nor five hours a day seems to be the upper limit of deliberate practice, \\nand this is frequently accomplished in sessions lasting no more than \\nan hour to ninety minutes. The best violinists in the Berlin study, for \\nexample, practiced about three and a half hours a day, typically in two \\nor three sessions. Many other top-level musicians report four or five \\nhours as their upper limit. Chess champions typically report the same \\namount of practice. Even elite athletes say the factor that limits their \\npractice time is their ability to sustain concentration. \\nNathan Milstein, one of the twentieth century\\'s greatest violinists, \\nwas a student of the famous teacher Leopold Auer (the one who pro-\\nnounced Tchaikovsky\\'s Violin Concerto unplayable, though he later \\nbecame a big fan of it). As the story goes, Milstein asked Auer if he was \\npracticing enough. Auer responded, \"Practice with your fingers and you \\nneed all day. Practice with your mind and you will do as much in one \\nand a half hours.\" \\nWhat Auer didn\\'t add is that it\\'s a good thing one and a half hours \\nare enough, because if you\\'re practicing with your mind, you couldn\\'t \\npossibly keep it up all day. \\nIt isn\\'t much fun. \\nThis follows inescapably from the other characteristics of deliberate \\npractice, which could be described as a recipe for not having fun. Doing \\nthings we know how to do well is enjoyable, and that\\'s exactly the op-\\nposite of what deliberate practice demands. Instead of doing what we\\'re \\ngood at, we insistently seek out what we\\'re not good at. Then we iden-\\ntify the painful, difficult activities that will make us better and do those \\nthings over and over. After each repetition, we force ourselves to see—\\nor get others to tell us—exactly what still isn\\'t right so we can repeat \\n71  Talent Is Overrated \\nthe most painful and difficult parts of what we\\'ve just done. We con-\\ntinue that process until we\\'re mentally exhausted. \\nEricsson and his colleagues stated it clearly in their article: Deliber-\\nate practice \"is not inherently enjoyable.\" \\nIf it seems a bit depressing that the most important thing you can \\ndo to improve performance is no fun, take consolation in this fact: It \\nmust be so. If the activities that lead to greatness were easy and fun, \\nthen everyone would do them and they would not distinguish the best \\nfrom the rest. The reality that deliberate practice is hard can even be \\nseen as good news. It means that most people won\\'t do it. So your will-\\ningness to do it will distinguish you all the more. \\nLessons from Chris Rock \\nThat is a brief initial description of deliberate practice, the series of ac-\\ntivities that seems to explain great performance most persuasively. If \\nyou work in one of the fields in which the concept of practice is most \\ndeeply entrenched—sports and music—you\\'re probably thinking that \\nEricsson and his colleagues have explained and elaborated ideas that \\nmany people in your world have understood for a long time. But \\nif you\\'re among the far more numerous people who make a living in \\nbusiness-related fields, you\\'re probably thinking: This is absolutely \\nnothing like work! \\nIn fact, life at most companies seems almost intended to defeat all \\nthe principles of deliberate practice. \\nMost fundamentally, what we generally do at work is directly op-\\nposed to the first principle: It isn\\'t designed by anyone to make us bet-\\nter at anything. Usually it isn\\'t designed at all; we\\'re just given an \\nobjective that\\'s necessary to meeting the employer\\'s goals and are ex-\\npected to get on with it. From the limited, short-term perspective of \\nmany employers, this is completely justified. We weren\\'t hired so we \\n72  What Deliberate Practice Is and Isn\\'t \\ncould spend time improving our own abilities; we were hired to pro-\\nduce results. \\nAs for the second principle, the activities that would make us bet-\\nter are usually not highly repeatable. When we face new or unusual \\nchallenges—a competitor\\'s innovation, a shift in customer attitudes—\\nwe typically find little past experience to guide us because we\\'ve had \\nso few chances to deal with those situations. We\\'re golfers encounter-\\ning the buried-lie sand shot two or three times a year, but we haven\\'t \\npracticed it two hundred times. Even in jobs where we do the same few \\nthings—negotiating with suppliers, administering benefits—we face \\nfew (if any) incentives to get better at them by exceeding our limits and \\ndiscovering what we can\\'t do well. On the contrary, while deliberate \\npractice demands that we push ourselves to the point where we break \\ndown and then develop a solution, in our business lives the cost of mis-\\ntakes is often high. Every incentive urges us to stick with what\\'s safe \\nand reliable. \\nFeedback? At most companies this is a travesty, consisting of an an-\\nnual performance review dreaded by the person delivering it and the \\none receiving it. Even if it\\'s well done, it cannot be very effective. Tell-\\ning someone what he did well or poorly on a task he completed eleven \\nmonths ago is just not helpful. \\nYou could say that work, like deliberate practice, is often mentally \\ndemanding and tiring. But that\\'s typically not because of the intense \\nfocus and concentration involved. Rather, it\\'s more often a result of \\nlong hours cranking out what we already know how to do. And if we\\'re \\nexhausted from that, the prospect of spending additional hours on gen-\\nuine deliberate practice activities seems too miserable to contemplate. \\nSimilarly, work is often not fun. But again, that\\'s not because we\\'re try-\\ning to push beyond the edge of our abilities. It\\'s because getting any-\\nthing accomplished in the real world is a grind. \\nIf that\\'s life in most companies, then the opportunities for achieving \\n73  Talent Is Overrated \\nadvantage by adopting the principles of great performance, individu-\\nally and organizationally, would seem to be huge. In fact they are, and \\nin later chapters we\\'ll look in detail at how that can be done. But first \\nit\\'s helpful to consider a bit more deeply just what deliberate practice \\nis. Indeed, what\\'s especially surprising about the cluelessness of most \\norganizations with regard to deliberate practice is that the principles \\nare not counterintuitive or hard to grasp. On the contrary, once we hear \\nthem enunciated, we start seeing them—and their effectiveness—in \\nmany domains. \\nConsider, as one example, how the comedian Chris Rock prepared \\nfor a high-profile, high-stakes performance he was to give on New Year\\'s \\nEve before an audience of twenty thousand at Madison Square Garden. \\nA newspaper article sets up the story as follows: \\nBecause he has been on top of the comic heap so long, it is easy to \\nassume that Mr. Rock can make that whole big room shake with the \\nsame convulsive laughter because he was born that way. Like Tiger \\nWoods, Bill Clinton or Tom Brady, he seems genetically predisposed \\nto do precisely what he does. \\nIt sounds like the article will be a classic example of the divine-spark \\ntheory, but in fact the article\\'s point is exactly the opposite. This is \\nsome of its remarkable description of how Chris Rock prepared for his \\nappearance: \\nThe least surprised person when that first laugh starts and then \\nmoves in a wave all the way up to the cheap seats will be Mr. Rock. \\nFor many months he has been piecing together his act in clubs in \\nNew Jersey, New York, Florida and Las Vegas. Comedy bit by comedy \\nbit, he has built two hours of material one minute at a time, culling \\nthe belly laughs from the bombs. . \\nFor him the 18 warm-up shows he did at the Stress Factory in New \\n74  What Deliberate Practice Is and Isn\\'t \\nBrunswick, N.J., preparing for the tour are more important than his \\nthree Emmys. \\n\"He knows that they are going to give him that first laugh because \\nof who he is,\" said Vinnie Brand, the owner of the Stress Factory. \"But \\nhe came out here and worked his material, over and over, cutting and \\ntrimming, until by the last show you could not believe what he had \\nput together. He still has that hunger to be a great stand-up comedian, \\nno matter what his name is.\" \\nHere we see all the elements of deliberate practice. Rock designed all \\nthose small-club appearances for the sole purpose of making himself \\nbetter; because he already performs at a very high level, he\\'s completely \\nqualified to design his own practice. The high repetition in the process \\nis particularly striking—appearance after appearance, working the ma-\\nterial \"over and over.\" Feedback happens to be no problem in Rock\\'s \\nprofession; the reaction of the audience—the only thing that counts—is \\nimmediate and continuous (and brutally honest). It\\'s clear that Rock \\nmust be focusing intensely on the process and that it can\\'t be much \\nfun, especially when new material doesn\\'t work, as must happen often. \\nThe result is Rock\\'s vast success; as the article put it, \"if he is not the \\nfunniest man alive, then the other guy is doing a good job of hiding.\" \\nA particularly dramatic illustration of deliberate practice is useful be-\\ncause it highlights the principles so clearly. It\\'s the story of the Polgar \\nsisters. \\nLaszlo Polgar, a Hungarian educational psychologist, formed the \\nview in the 196 0s that great performers are made, not born. His re-\\nsearch persuaded him that the greatest performers had all been made \\nto focus and work on their field of eventual achievement from an early \\nage, and he believed he understood the process well enough that he \\ncould make it happen himself. He wrote a book about how to do it (En-\\nglish translation of the title: Bring Up Genius!) and publicly asked for \\n75  Talent Is Overrated \\na woman who would marry him, have children with him, and help \\nhim conduct the experiment. Amazingly enough, he found such a \\nwoman, a Hungarian-speaking schoolteacher in the Ukraine named \\nKlara. \\nLaszlo and Klara soon had a daughter, Susan, and when Susan turned \\nfour the experiment began. Exactly why Laszlo decided to turn Susan \\ninto a chess player is not clear. By some accounts it was because prog-\\nress in chess is apparent and easy to measure from the beginning. By \\nother accounts it was because chess is heavily male-dominated, and the \\nprevailing view was that women were simply incapable of competing \\nat the highest level—so this would be the ideal realm in which Laszlo \\ncould prove his theory. \\nLaszlo and Klara devoted their lives to teaching Susan chess, and \\nwhen two more daughters followed—Sophia and Judit—they were put \\ninto the program as well. All three daughters were homeschooled—the \\nparents quit their jobs to devote themselves to the work—and the \\nschooling consisted largely of chess instruction. The family accumu-\\nlated a library of ten thousand chess books. A giant pre-computer-age \\nfiling system of index cards cataloged previous games and potential \\nopponents. The daughters learned other subjects as well; the Hungar-\\nian authorities insisted that they all pass regular exams in school sub-\\njects, and all three daughters spoke several languages. But chess was \\nthe main thing—hours and hours of it every day. \\nThe results: At age seventeen, Susan became the first woman to \\nqualify for what was then called the Men\\'s World Championship \\n(though she qualified, the World Chess Federation wouldn\\'t let her \\ncompete). When Susan was nineteen, Sophia fourteen, and Judit twelve, \\nthey competed as a team in the Women\\'s Olympiad and scored Hun-\\ngary\\'s first-ever victory against the Soviets, becoming national heroes. \\nAt age twenty-one, Susan became the first woman ever to be named a \\ngrand master, the highest rank in world chess. Soon thereafter, Judit \\nbecame a grand master at age fifteen, the youngest person of either sex \\n76  What Deliberate Practice Is and Isn\\'t \\never to win that designation, beating Bobby Fischer\\'s previous rec-\\nord by a few months. As of this writing Judit is the world\\'s number \\nwoman player, and for years she ranked consistently in the top ten of \\nall players worldwide. \\nThe Polgars\\' story is exceptionally useful because it illustrates the \\nprinciples of deliberate practice through what the sisters achieved as \\nwell as through what they did not. Overall, of course, their tremendous \\nsuccess would seem to validate emphatically what their father believed. \\nThere was no reason to suppose that Laszlo or Klara passed on any \\ninnate chess ability to their daughters; Laszlo was only a mediocre \\nplayer, and Klara had demonstrated no chess ability at all. The chil-\\ndren\\'s success would seem to have resulted only from their years of in-\\ntensive work, which met the definition of deliberate practice in every \\nparticular. \\nAt the same time, it must be noted that the daughters did not achieve \\nequal levels of success, and none of them reached the very highest level, \\nthe world championship. But these facts are also consistent with the \\nprinciples of deliberate practice. The middle sister, Sophia, did not reach \\nthe heights scaled by her two sisters (though she did become the sixth-\\nranked woman in the world), and everyone seems to agree that she was \\nthe least committed. A lengthy magazine profile of the sisters quoted \\nchess champion Josh Waitzkin as saying Sophia \"was a brilliant speed \\nplayer, sharp as a tack. But she didn\\'t work as hard as the others.\" Susan \\nsaid that Sophia \"was lazy\" And even Sophia agreed: \"I could give up \\neasier than Judit. I never worked as hard as she did.\" Similarly, everyone \\nseems to agree that Judit, who rose highest, worked hardest at practice. \\nIt would also stand to reason that by the time Judit, the youngest, came \\nalong, Laszlo had refined his methods of practice design. \\nAs for the fact that none of the sisters became a world champion, \\nit may be hazardous to speculate on why things work out as they do \\nin the rarefied air of the very highest levels. But it\\'s certainly worth not-\\ning that when they were in their twenties, when future champions are \\n77  Talent Is Overrated \\ntypically still fighting for their shot at the top, all three sisters decided \\nthere was more to life than chess. (As Sophia was quoted as saying: \"It\\'s \\nnot that chess was too much for me; it was too little.\") They got married, \\nhad kids, gave time to their families, and eased up on the unrelenting \\nchess-focused work that had filled their lives until then. \\nTheir own stories have convinced them that their father was right. \\nSusan said, \"My father believes that innate talent is nothing, that [suc-\\ncess] is 99 percent hard work. I agree with him.\" More specifically, \\nthe story of the Polgars illustrates how the principles of deliberate prac-\\ntice, when carried to an extraordinary level, produce extraordinary \\nachievement. \\nWhat We Need to Know Next \\nIt\\'s easy to find more familiar stories that reinforce the validity of the \\ndeliberate practice framework. We can quickly see, for example, that \\nJerry Rice was a near-perfect example of the principles through \\nwhat he did, and the intensity and focus with which he did it. We see \\nthat the story of Tiger Woods\\'s development, described in chapter 2, \\nconforms exactly to these principles. They are exemplified in the stories \\nof almost every other top-level athlete, as well as in the lives of eminent \\nmusicians and many others. In particular, there are countless stories of \\npeople who not only seemed to lack any natural advantage in a field \\nwhere they eventually excelled but were clearly disadvantaged—yet \\nthrough these principles overcame the obstacles. One thinks of Wilma \\nRudolph, hobbled by polio as a child, who won three Olympic gold \\nmedals in track and field. Or the lisping Winston Churchill, who be-\\ncame one of the twentieth century\\'s greatest orators by practicing his \\nmany speeches intensively and with great precision over a period of \\nmany years. \\nWith the deliberate practice framework in mind, examples are \\neverywhere. But questions immediately arise. The most pressing: \\n78  What Deliberate Practice Is and Isn\\'t \\nIs that all there is? \\nDoes deliberate practice fully explain high achievement? Will someone \\nwho does twice as much of it as someone else be twice as successful? \\nThe answer to these questions is clearly no. Deliberate practice does \\nnot fully explain achievement—real life is too complicated for that. \\nMost obviously, we\\'re all affected by luck; time and chance happeneth \\nto us all, as it says in Ecclesiastes. While it has often been observed that \\nthose who work the hardest seem to be the luckiest, the fact remains \\nthat if a bridge collapses while you\\'re driving over it, nothing else mat-\\nters. Less dramatically but much more significantly, a person\\'s cir-\\ncumstances, especially in childhood, can powerfully affect his or her \\nopportunities to engage in deliberate practice. We may say that Tiger \\nWoods is a textbook illustration of the deliberate practice principles, \\nbut we could also say that he was breathtakingly lucky to be introduced \\nto them. In this sense, it\\'s perfectly fair to say that the real reason you\\'ll \\nnever be Tiger Woods is that your father wasn\\'t Earl Woods. In chapter \\nio we\\'ll look more closely at the importance of the supporting environ-\\nment, much of which may be outside a person\\'s control, especially in \\nyouth. \\nBeyond simple luck, we know that physical changes are inevitable \\nover time. It turns out that deliberate practice can extend one\\'s ability \\nto perform at high levels far longer than most people believe, as we \\nshall see in chapter 10. But ultimately we\\'re all mortal, and our faculties \\ndecline. This fact may be more significant than it seems. A person\\'s \\ntotal lifetime hours of deliberate practice can never decline, so if that \\nwere the only factor that determined performance, no one would ever \\nget worse at anything they\\'ve learned. Since everyone does get worse \\neventually, even if only at a very advanced age, then it must be possible \\nfor factors outside our control to affect our performance. We\\'ll look into \\nthis more deeply later. \\nIn addition, even though performance seems to improve with \\n79  Talent Is Overrated \\nincreased deliberate practice in a wide range of research studies, it must \\nalso be true that the relationship cannot be simple and direct in every \\ncase. That is, there must be qualitative differences between my practice \\nand yours. In many cases these will arise from the varying quality of \\nteachers, coaches, and mentors. Practice is designed, so it can be de-\\nsigned well or badly. \\nRegardless of how well it\\'s designed, another important variable is \\nhow much effort a person puts into it. We\\'ve all engaged in deliberate \\npractice at something—a musical instrument, a sport, or something \\nelse—so we all understand Leopold Auer\\'s remark about practicing with \\nthe mind. Some days we were sharp, focused, and working hard; other \\ndays we were tired, distracted, and going through the motions. Measur-\\ning the intensity of practice may be difficult, but it\\'s clearly significant. \\nA study of singers found that when amateurs took a voice lesson, they \\nexperienced it as an enjoyable release of tension, but when profession-\\nals took a lesson, they experienced it as an intense, difficult effort. Seen \\nfrom the outside, they were doing the same thing, but on the inside they \\nwere doing completely different things, and that\\'s what mattered. \\nComparing hours of practice by large numbers of people reveals im-\\nportant trends, but comparing hours put in by specific people may not \\ntell us much if we don\\'t also know the intensity of practice. Which leads \\nto a related question . . . \\nWhat determines who does it? \\nConsidering that deliberate practice is so demanding and in itself un-\\nrewarding, and that high achievement demands thousands of hours of \\nit over a period of many years, why do some people put themselves \\nthrough it while most do not? If the road to extraordinary performance \\nis apparent, then why do so few people choose to follow it? This turns \\nout to be a very deep question, so deep that we devote an entire chapter \\nto it (chapter 1.1). For the moment we note that merely raising the ques-\\ntion introduces another significant issue . . . \\n8o  What Deliberate Practice Is and Isn\\'t \\nCould the explanation possibly be genetic? \\nThe whole notion of deliberate practice has for many people created \\nthe notion of a nature-versus-nurture battle, with practice advocates \\npitted against proponents of the divine-spark hypothesis. But it\\'s im-\\nportant to note that advocates of the deliberate practice framework \\nhave never excluded the possibility of a genetic role in high-level \\nperformance. Their stance has been that they have not yet seen the \\nevidence supporting it. Certainly if we\\'re looking for specific DNA com-\\nponents that make someone an exceptional oboist or fighter pilot or \\nsalesperson—or, to put the same idea another way, if we\\'re seeking spe-\\ncific DNA that limits a particular person\\'s ability to excel in these \\nfields—then the search has come up dry so far. But practice proponents \\ndo not dispute the possibility that genes could play a role in a person\\'s \\nwillingness to put himself or herself through the extremely rigorous \\ndemands of becoming an exceptional performer. \\nSome people, especially those who favor explanations based on in-\\nnate talents, just don\\'t like that possibility, even though it\\'s genetically \\nbased. They call it \"the drudge theory.\" For now all we can say is that \\nit\\'s a hypothesis that has not been tested, let alone proved or disproved. \\nWe may well gain new insight into it as DNA research gallops forward. \\nAt the same time, that research is revealing many ways in which DNA \\nand the environment interact from the moment of conception all the \\nway through life, and suggesting increasingly that the concept of strict \\nnature-versus-nurture conflict is unhelpful in understanding how peo-\\nple actually develop. This also is part of what we\\'ll consider in chapter \\n11, after we\\'ve looked more closely into how deliberate practice works. \\nWhat is all that practice doing? \\nWhile it\\'s clear that extensive deliberate practice will make someone a \\nsuperior surgeon or billiard player or public speaker, it\\'s natural to won- \\nder if the effect can be understood in some general way. Beyond simply \\n81  Talent Is Overrated \\nmaking a person better at the specific task they\\'re practicing, is it doing \\nsomething that applies across cases? The answer is yes, and it\\'s worth \\nidentifying because it\\'s the opposite of what most people think. \\nIf you\\'re a golf fan, you may have seen videotape of Tiger Woods in \\na particular situation that has occurred a few times in his career. He\\'s \\nin a tournament, standing over the ball, about to hit his shot. At some \\nmoment after he has begun his swing but before he has hit the ball, a \\nmajor distraction happens—a fan yells, someone moves sharply, the \\ncrowd roars elsewhere on the course. Woods stops himself in midswing, \\nsteps back from the ball, recomposes himself, and then steps forward \\nand hits the shot. \\nOrdinary golfers respond with awe when they see this happen be-\\ncause they know what they\\'d do in the same circumstance: Unable to \\nstop their swing once they\\'d started it, they would carry through and \\nhit a terrible shot or maybe miss the ball completely. \\nWhy is this significant? Frequently when we see great performers \\ndoing what they do, it strikes us that they\\'ve practiced for so long, and \\ndone it so many times, they can just do it automatically. But in fact, \\nwhat they have achieved is the ability to avoid doing it automatically. \\nWhen we learn to do anything new—how to drive, for example—we \\ngo through three stages. The first stage demands a lot of attention as \\nwe try out the controls, learn the rules of driving, and so on. In the sec-\\nond stage we begin to coordinate our knowledge, linking movements \\ntogether and more fluidly combining our actions with our knowledge \\nof the car, the situation, and the rules. In the third stage we drive the \\ncar with barely a thought. It\\'s automatic. And with that our improve-\\nment at driving slows dramatically, eventually stopping completely. \\nFor most of the things we do, including driving, that\\'s not a problem. \\nWe don\\'t need to be great at such things, just good enough to carry on \\nwith our lives. That category of activities includes golf for most people \\nwho play the game. They don\\'t need to earn a living at it; they just want \\nto be able to have fun with it. Not having to devote much thought to \\n82  What Deliberate Practice Is and Isn\\'t \\nsuch activities is a blessing, since it frees our minds to focus on other \\nmatters that we consider more important. But it does mean that our \\nbrains have pretty much checked out when we\\'re doing these things. \\nIf your golfing opponent jingles his change at the top of your back-\\nswing, he can probably reach the part of your brain that responds in-\\nstinctively to sudden noises; since you\\'re on autopilot, you\\'re helpless \\nto stop your now-doomed swing. \\nBy contrast, great performers never allow themselves to reach the \\nautomatic, arrested-development stage in their chosen field. That is the \\neffect of continual deliberate practice—avoiding automaticity. The es-\\nsence of practice, which is constantly trying to do the things one cannot \\ndo comfortably, makes automatic behavior impossible. It\\'s certainly \\ntrue that a great performer is able to do many things in his or her field \\nwith far fewer mental demands than a novice performer; an excellent \\npilot lands a 747 without breaking a sweat. But ultimately the perfor-\\nmance is always conscious and controlled, not automatic. \\nAvoiding automaticity through continual practice is another way of \\nsaying that great performers are always getting better. This is why the \\nmost devoted can stay at the top of their field for far longer than most \\npeople would think possible. We\\'ll examine this phenomenon more \\nclosely in chapter to. \\nHow does it work? \\nWhile it seems intuitively right that extensive deliberate practice would \\nmake someone very good, we cannot fully understand what\\'s happen-\\ning, and cannot put it to best use, unless we know how it works. What \\nspecifically is going on inside a person as a result of these activities? \\nWhat changes? How can we help it along? We turn to these important \\nquestions next. \\n83  Chapter Six \\nHow Deliberate Practice Works \\nThe specific ways it changes us, \\nand how that makes all the difference \\nAt this point the evidence seems strong that the right kind of practice \\ncan turn someone of unremarkable endowments into a much better, \\neven exceptional performer. But we\\'re still left wondering how it hap-\\npens. Until we understand that, the theoretical framework can\\'t be \\nentirely persuasive, and we cannot apply it in the most effective way. \\nIt would be like knowing that an engine is what makes a car go—\\nextremely important to know, but if we don\\'t understand how the en-\\ngine works, we can never make the car go faster or run more efficiently. \\nSo—what makes deliberate practice work? \\nIn general, we\\'ve seen that practice is all about pushing ourselves just \\nbeyond what we can currently do. Now we need to get more specific. \\nWe need to know which systems, physical or mental, the great perform-\\ners overstrain and build up. It turns out the answer is the same whether \\nwe look at business or sports or any other field, and it isn\\'t what you \\nmight expect. \\nIndeed, the most important effect of practice in great performers is \\nthat it takes them beyond—or, more precisely, around—the limitations \\nthat most of us think of as critical. Specifically, it enables them to per-\\nceive more, to know more, and to remember more than most people. \\nEventually the effects go beyond even that. Many years of intensive \\ndeliberate practice actually change the body and the brain. There\\'s a \\n84  How Deliberate Practice Works \\ngood reason why we see the world\\'s great performers as being funda-\\nmentally different from us, as operating on a completely different \\nplane. It\\'s because they are and they do. But they didn\\'t start out that \\nway, and the transformation didn\\'t happen by itself. \\nLet\\'s examine each of the major ways deliberate practice changes a \\nperson. \\nPerceiving More \\nIn his book Blink, Malcolm Gladwell describes the uncanny ability of \\nVic Braden to predict when a tennis player is going to double-fault. You \\nget two chances to make a legal serve in tennis, and if a player had \\nfaulted on the first attempt, then on the second serve, at a moment after \\nthe player had tossed the ball into the air but before he or she had hit \\nit, Braden would predict whether it would be a fault, and he was almost \\nalways right. Braden was then a very famous tennis teacher, having \\nspent a long career as a professional player. In Gladwell\\'s book, Braden \\nsays he\\'s baffled by this ability, has no idea where it comes from. \\nGladwell does not venture to explain it and presents it as an intriguing \\nmystery. \\nNo research seems to have been conducted on Braden, so we can\\'t \\nsay for sure how he did it. But as it happens, research on other excellent \\ntennis players shows that in general they know where a serve is going \\nto go earlier than average players—like Braden, they know even before \\nthe ball is hit—and explains quite clearly how they do it. This is impor-\\ntant because it\\'s a good example of how most of us misunderstand what \\nmakes exceptional performers so good. \\nA top-ranked male tennis player will serve the ball at speeds ap-\\nproaching and occasionally exceeding 150 mph. (Andy Roddick seems \\nto hold the record in competition, 155 mph.) At that speed, the ball will \\ntravel from the server\\'s racket to the opponent\\'s service line in just over \\na quarter of a second. Most of us, facing such a serve, would have a hard \\n85  Talent Is Overrated \\ntime turning our heads fast enough to watch it shoot past us. Yet top \\nplayers routinely return those serves. The conclusion we tend to draw \\nis that top players have incredible reaction times, enabling them to \\nwatch that ball come at them and get themselves in proper position in \\na quarter of a second. \\nTop professionals do indeed have very fast reaction times, and reac-\\ntion speed can be improved with practice, so professionals work on it. \\nThe problem is that improvements in reaction speed follow what sci-\\nentists call a power law (because there\\'s an exponent in the formula) \\nand what the rest of us call the 8 0-20 rule. That is, nearly all the im-\\nprovement comes in the first little bit of training. After that, lots more \\npractice yields only a little additional improvement. Top tennis pros \\nhave all pushed themselves to the point where it\\'s tough to achieve any \\nmore reaction speed. The very best, however, have found a way to get \\naround that limitation. \\nResearchers showed tennis players films of opponents serving at \\nthem, and used sophisticated equipment to track precisely their eye \\nmovements. Average players focused on the ball. But in the brief period \\nbetween the start of the serving motion and the moment when the \\nracket hits the ball—the period when Braden could detect the impend-\\ning fault—the best players weren\\'t looking at the ball. They were look-\\ning at the opponent\\'s hips, shoulders, and arms, which foretold where \\nthey would hit the ball. The researchers then stopped the film at the \\nmoment of contact and asked the test subjects where the serve was \\ngoing to go. The average players, being focused on the ball, had no idea. \\nBut the best players knew, and as a result, they could start positioning \\nthemselves to return the serve even before the serve was hit. By the \\ntime the ball landed, they were already there. \\nThey had found a way to react faster without improving their reac-\\ntion time. \\nResearchers have uncovered the same phenomenon in many kinds \\nof sports and in a wide range of other activities. Top performers can \\n86  How Deliberate Practice Works \\nfigure out what\\'s going to happen sooner than average performers by \\nseeing more in badminton, cricket, field hockey, squash, and volleyball. \\nBeyond sports, we see a similar result in the mundane but instructive \\nfield of typing. Why, specifically, can some people type so much faster \\nthan most? As in tennis, a person can go only so far in increasing reac-\\ntion speed. The very fastest typists achieve their advantage by looking \\nfarther ahead in the text, which enables them to keep moving their fin-\\ngers into place for the next keystroke just a little bit ahead of time (and, \\nin particular, to hit successive letters typed with opposite hands espe-\\ncially fast, which is their most effective way of outrunning average typ-\\nists). When researchers prevented top typists from looking farther \\nahead in the text, they performed scarcely better than novices. \\nSometimes excellent performers see more by developing better and \\nfaster understanding of what they see. For example, accomplished and \\nnovice drivers were tested for their reactions to hazardous situations; \\nthey were shown films of various dangerous incidents from the driver\\'s \\nperspective. Again, the accomplished performers, facing the familiar \\nlimits on response time, didn\\'t react any faster than the novices, but \\nthey understood what they were seeing much more quickly. The nov-\\nices remained fixated on the hazardous situation much longer than the \\nexperienced drivers did, trying to comprehend it. The better drivers got \\nit right away and thus had more time available to respond. \\nEven jugglers display similar abilities. Juggling—which is how most \\nof us describe how we manage our lives—is a skill of continual moni-\\ntoring, watching the balls and making constant tiny adjustments. Good \\njugglers don\\'t need to see the whole path of the balls. When their vision \\nis restricted, they can make the necessary adjustments as long as \\nthey can see just the apex of each ball\\'s trajectory. Though seeing \\nvery little, they see more than average jugglers and understand all they \\nneed to. \\nTime and again we see the same themes, and so far we have consid-\\nered just one type of situation in which top performers see more—cases \\n87  Talent Is Overrated \\nrequiring rapid responses. In fact the superior perception of experts \\nshows up in many other ways. \\nConsider, for example, the reading of X-rays. Reaction time doesn\\'t \\nplay an important role, but the stakes can be extremely high. In a study, \\nexpert radiologists and first- to fourth-year residents were asked to ex-\\namine several X-rays, taking as long as they wanted, and to give their \\ndiagnoses and mark what they considered the problematic areas on the \\nX-rays. The sample X-rays used in the study showed various serious \\nproblems, such as multiple tumors or a collapsed lung. \\nIt shouldn\\'t be surprising that the experts performed better; they \\nwere far more likely to spot the collapsed lung, for instance. But why? \\nThe middle lobe of the lung was collapsed and produced a dense \\nshadow, but this feature could lead to a diagnosis of a tumor. The cor-\\nrect diagnosis required doctors to also see subtler cues, such as hyper-\\ninflation of the adjacent lobes. In marking the X-ray films, the experts \\npicked out more specific features that were significant; they saw more \\nclues to help them solve the puzzle of diagnosis. They also discrimi-\\nnated more finely. For example, the film showing tumors had a few \\nhazy spots on it. The residents saw them as \"general lung haziness\" and \\nfigured they indicated fluid in the lungs, a sign of congestive heart fail-\\nure. The experts saw correctly that each spot was a tumor. \\nThe experts did not have sharper eyes in the usual sense. They were \\nall looking at the same films and could see them just as clearly. The dif-\\nference wasn\\'t literally what they saw. It was what they perceived. \\nThe superior perception of top performers extends beyond the sense \\nof sight. They hear more when they listen and feel more when they \\ntouch. Highly trained pilots and apprentice pilots were asked to listen \\nto a dialogue between pilots and air traffic controllers, and then to \\nchoose a diagram that best represented the situation they had just heard \\nbeing talked about. The well-trained pilots were twice as good. Musi-\\ncians are much better than nonmusicians at detecting very small dif-\\nferences in pitch and loudness of notes. Everyone in these studies is \\n88  How Deliberate Practice Works \\nhearing the same things, but through years of practice, some are per-\\nceiving more. \\nThe relevance of these findings for business seems obvious. Specifi-\\ncally, we can abstract from the research a few ways, directly applicable \\nin business, that top performers perceive more. \\nThey understand the significance of indicators that average \\nperformers don\\'t even notice. \\nJust as top tennis players look at the server\\'s body, not at the tennis ball, \\nexcellent performers in other fields have learned to spot nonobvious \\ninformation that\\'s important. Sometimes these signals are profound \\nand become widely known. More than thirty years ago, when Wal-Mart \\nhad a very different reputation for employee relations than it does \\ntoday, Sam Walton found an innovative way to gauge customer satis-\\nfaction. He realized that the best indicator of how happy his customers \\nwere was to measure how happy his employees were; the way manag-\\ners treated the employees was the way employees would treat the cus-\\ntomers (a lesson the company might want to reflect on). \\nMore often these indicators are small but telling. Certain retail ex-\\necutives have been known to survey the oil stains in a store\\'s parking \\nlot to see how well the customers are maintaining their cars and thus \\ngauge their financial condition. In the 198 0s, when fitness was a heav-\\nily hyped trend, a business research firm dug through clothing sales \\nstatistics and found that the sales volume of clothing size extra-large \\nand larger was increasing fast, an early tip-off that America was getting \\nfatter, not fitter. Laura Rittenhouse, an unusual type of financial analyst, \\ncounts the number of times the word / occurs in annual letters to share-\\nholders from corporate CEOs, contending that this and other evidence \\nin the letters helps predict company performance (basic finding: Ego-\\nmaniacs are bad news). \\nOften these nonobvious indicators are well-guarded secrets. Some \\nhedge funds, for example, use mathematical models built on reliable \\n89  Talent Is Overrated \\nrelationships that the fund owners have discovered in the financial \\nmarkets. Renaissance Technologies uses such models, and founder \\nJames Simons has for several years made more than $ 1 billion a year  \\npersonally from the fund. If Renaissance\\'s proprietary models were to \\nbecome widely known and applied, the fund\\'s advantage would disap-\\npear, so it\\'s understandable that Simons doesn\\'t like to talk about them. \\nMore generally in business and other fields, nonobvious indicators may \\nbe so valuable that most of us never know about them. \\nIn general, regardless of whether indicators are secret, developing \\nand using them requires extensive practice. For example, if you play \\ntennis, you now know one of the ways that pros return serves so well. \\nYet you probably won\\'t be able to do much with that information the \\nnext time you\\'re on the court because you haven\\'t spent hundreds of \\nhours learning how to read the subtle movements of your opponent\\'s \\nhips, shoulders, and arms. Most of the indicators used by top perform-\\ners require practice to be of any use. \\nThey look further ahead. \\nWhen excellent musicians or typists look further ahead on the page \\nthan average performers do, they are literally looking into their own \\nfuture. Knowing what lies ahead for them, they prepare for it and thus \\nperform better. They may be looking only one second ahead, but for \\nthem that extra moment makes all the difference. In other fields the \\ntime periods are obviously much greater, and the advantages just as \\nimportant. \\nThis is not about fortune-telling, or hiring Nostradamus or an as-\\ntrologer. Much of the power of looking further ahead comes from the \\nsimple act of raising one\\'s gaze and getting a new perspective, and \\ndoing it not once or occasionally, but using practice principles to do it \\noften and get better at it. When was the last time you, in your working \\nrole, participated in a deep discussion about the state of your business \\nfive years from now? How about fifteen years from now, including a \\n90  How Deliberate Practice Works \\nlook at the future of your business\\'s environment, competitors, regula-\\ntors, and other factors? Such discussions rarely happen below the level \\nof the CEO, yet the experience of excellent performers suggests they \\noffer advantages for everyone. \\nA few companies look far into the future as a matter of policy. Japan \\nscholar John Nathan recalls meeting with Panasonic founder Konosuke \\nMatsushita, widely regarded as one of the twentieth century\\'s greatest \\nbusinesspeople; they were in a small boat on a pond at the company \\ncompound. Matsushita clapped his hands once. Within moments, sev-\\neral large fish rose to the surface, recognizing the signal for feeding. \\n\"These fish understand the long term,\" he said. \"They live for a hundred \\nyears.\" Matsushita looked further ahead than that: He had a five-\\nhundred-year plan for his company, which is now more than ninety \\nyears old and remains powerful in the notoriously volatile electronics \\nindustry. \\nOil companies look further into the future than most because they \\nmust. Negotiating the rights to an oil field may take many years, then \\ndeveloping it may take another decade, and with luck it will produce \\noil for decades more. That\\'s why major oil companies routinely look at \\nforecasts of oil supply and demand one hundred years from now. The \\nbest ones look beyond the numbers to see possible causes and effects. \\nFor example, Shell\\'s scenario planning process famously prepared it \\nfor the Arab oil embargo of the 197 0s. No scenario told Shell\\'s manag-\\ners the embargo would happen, since scenarios are thought exercises, \\nnot predictions. But one of the scenarios the strategy group cooked up \\nenvisioned an accident in Saudi Arabia that raised the price of oil, caus-\\ning Arab producers to rethink why they set prices as they did. Shell \\nmanagers carried the analysis further and realized that Arab producers, \\nangry with the United States for its support of Israel in the Six -Day War, \\nmight believe they could serve many purposes at once by launching an \\nembargo or restricting supply. \\nBecause they had done the exercise, Shell managers could see how \\n91  Talent Is Overrated \\nevents might lead to an embargo, and when it happened, they were \\nmuch better prepared than their competitors to respond. They had seen \\nthis movie already, so they slowed refinery expansion and adapted their \\nrefineries to handle many types of crude, while competitors vacillated. \\nThe common view in the industry is that Shell came through the oil \\nshock far better than any other major producer. \\nThese days it\\'s common to question whether looking further ahead \\nis worth the effort, since short-termism seems rampant. The conven-\\ntional view is that no one is looking past the next quarter. But like much \\nconventional wisdom, this just isn\\'t so. Look at the stock tables any day \\nand you\\'ll find plenty of companies, many of them in biotechnology or \\ninfotech, with no profits and no prospect of profits anytime soon, yet \\nwith considerable share prices. Investors are valuing these companies \\nby looking years into the future. Fashions in the market come and go, \\nbut the future always counts, and looking further into it—rationally--is \\nalways an advantage. \\nThey know more from seeing less. \\nThis ability is essential for success in every real-life domain because we \\nnever have as much information as we want. Getting information \\npushes at the two constraints everyone faces: It takes time and costs \\nmoney. Making sound decisions fast and at low cost is a competitive \\nadvantage everywhere. \\nTop performers, through extensive practice, learn this ability for de-\\ncisions that are most critical in their field. Police officers learn how to \\ndecide in a split second whether to shoot. Quarterbacks learn to decide \\nfrom very few cues whether to throw the ball, and if so, where. Even in \\nbusiness, where linebackers aren\\'t running at you, deciding fast with \\nsparse information is often an advantage. That\\'s easiest to see on Wall \\nStreet, where a difference of thirty seconds can turn a winning trade \\ninto a losing one, but it\\'s also true in other businesses where the time \\ndemands aren\\'t quite so intense. Jack Welch, who considered people \\n92  How Deliberate Practice Works \\ndecisions the heart of his job as CEO, would sometimes make them very \\nquickly. He met a young GE auditor named John Rice at a lunch and \\nrecalls, \"I liked him instantly.\" A presentation Rice gave impressed \\nWelch, who gave Rice \"a battlefield promotion\" on the spot. From that \\ncareer turning point, Rice became one of GE\\'s biggest stars and a vice \\nchairman of the company by age fifty. Welch didn\\'t know much about \\nRice when he set him on the path, but he knew enough. And he knew \\nit because intensive, disciplined people evaluations had been central to \\nWelch\\'s career for decades. \\nThey make finer discriminations than average performers. \\nIt was said of Charles Revson, the entrepreneur who built Revlon into \\na dominant cosmetics firm, that he could distinguish several different \\nshades of black, a particularly difficult skill even among people who \\nwork with colors. That ability is a metaphor for making evaluations of \\nevery kind. For example, it\\'s one thing to say that a manager is \"good \\nwith people.\" It\\'s another to ask whether a manager notices when a di-\\nrect report seems no longer challenged by his or her job. If so, is that \\nseen as a problem or an opportunity? What responses are proposed? \\nOf these, how effective or ineffective do they seem, and which, if any, \\nare applied? It\\'s a matter of seeing black versus seeing five shades of \\nblack, and it works in evaluating people, situations, proposals, perfor-\\nmances, products, or anything else. In each case, seeing differences that \\nothers don\\'t see is another way of perceiving more. \\nNote that all these crucial abilities are clearly results of training and \\npractice. We know this because in many cases they are abilities that \\nthose in a given field work on diligently, and that instructors try hard \\nto teach. We know it also because research shows that these abilities \\ngenerally don\\'t transfer beyond the field in which they were learned. \\nWe may be tempted to say, for example, that an excellent musician \"has \\na good ear,\" meaning an ability to make fine distinctions. But research \\n93  Talent Is Overrated \\nshows that musicians who can distinguish extremely fine differences \\nin music tones are no better than average in distinguishing different \\ntones in speech. Deliberate practice works by helping us acquire the \\nspecific abilities we need to excel in a given field. \\nKnowing More \\nIt may seem painfully obvious that great performers know more than \\naverage ones; we expect a great investor, for example, to know much \\nmore about his or her area of investing than average investors do. But \\nit isn\\'t nearly as obvious as it may seem, and in fact there was a time \\nwhen many researchers believed it was not true. A bit of what they be-\\nlieved probably still resides in what most of us think. \\nThese researchers thought that great performance came not from \\nsuperior knowledge but from superior reasoning methods and reason-\\ning power. You didn\\'t really have to know much about a field if you \\nknew the best ways to analyze a problem and think it through, and you \\nneeded to know even less if your analysis and reasoning power could \\nbe juiced by a computer. This line of thought was especially popular in \\nthe early days of computers, from the 195 0s to the 1970s, when scien-\\ntists were searching for ways to create intelligent machines and any-\\nthing seemed possible. So heady was their ambition that in 1957 two \\nscientists (Herbert Simon and Allen Newell) announced a computer \\nprogram they called the General Problem Solver. It didn\\'t know any-\\nthing about anything in particular, but it possessed rules of logic and \\nproblem-solving strategy that could, in theory, be applied universally. \\nIt never did solve any real-world problems, but it showed the direction \\nof much scientific thinking: You didn\\'t need specific knowledge as long \\nas you had a sufficiently powerful intellectual engine. \\nEventually researchers began to realize that knowledge-free comput-\\ning power wasn\\'t producing the results they\\'d hoped for. To see how \\ntheir approach wasn\\'t working, consider one of the most celebrated at- \\n94  How Deliberate Practice Works \\ntempts to produce artificial expertise, the quest for a successful chess-\\nplaying computer program. Here was the perfect setting for the \\nknowledge-doesn\\'t-matter approach. Just tell the computer the rules \\nand the object of the game, and then turn it loose with its awesome \\nspeed and reasoning capacity, which no human could begin to match. \\nThe machine\\'s triumph was inevitable. \\nThe trouble was that humans kept winning. That was a big problem \\nbecause chess researchers estimate that from any given position, even \\na top-ranked player needs about fifteen seconds to think through each \\npossible move. By contrast, the early chess programs could try out thou-\\nsands of moves per second. How could humans ever win? When Garry \\nKasparov, the world champion at the time, first played IBM\\'s famous \\nDeep Blue program in 1996, the computer was evaluating 100 million \\npositions per second—and Kasparov still won. A year later the com-\\nputer had been upgraded to evaluate zoo million positions per second, \\nand Deep Blue finally won the six-game match: two games to one, with \\nthree draws. \\nYet in light of its staggering advantages, why would the computer \\nlose or draw even a single game against any player, ever? The answer \\nis that the human possessed something the computer didn\\'t, which was \\nvast knowledge of chess—how previous masters had responded to par-\\nticular positions in many different cases, and what kinds of choices \\ngenerally produced what kinds of consequences. Eventually research-\\ners from a broad array of fields realized where the secret lay. \"The most \\nimportant ingredient in any expert system is knowledge,\" wrote three \\neminent scientists who work on expert computer systems (Bruce G. \\nBuchanan, Randall Davis, and Edward A. Feigenbaum). \"Programs that \\nare rich in general inference methods—some of which may even have \\nsome of the power of mathematical logic—but poor in domain-specific \\nknowledge can behave expertly on almost no tasks.\" Their conclusion: \\n\"In the knowledge resides the power.\" \\nAs it happened, other researchers were arriving at the same place by \\n95  Talent Is Overrated \\na different route, though they also were studying chess. A Dutch psy-\\nchologist named Adriaan de Groot compared world-class players with \\ngood club-level players and found, surprisingly, that the world-class \\nplayers didn\\'t consider more possible moves than the less-accomplished \\nplayers, nor did they search any deeper (more moves into the future), \\nnor were their rules of thumb for choosing moves any different. In sum, \\ntheir intellectual engines didn\\'t seem to be turning any faster. So what \\nmade them better? \\nPart of the answer, which seems to apply in every domain, is that \\nthey had more knowledge about their field. In chess, researchers have \\nfound (using a method I\\'ll describe a little later) that master-level play-\\ners possess more chess knowledge than good club-level players by a \\nhuge margin, a factor of ten to one hundred. Just as important, top per-\\nformers in a wide range of fields have better organized and consolidated \\ntheir knowledge, enabling them to approach problems in fundamen-\\ntally different and more useful ways. For example, accomplished physi-\\ncists and beginning physics students were given two dozen physics \\nproblems and asked to sort them by type of problem. The beginners \\nsorted the problems according to their most obvious features, such as \\nwhether they involved friction or an inclined plane. The more expert \\nphysicists sorted them by the basic principles—say, Newton\\'s second \\nlaw—that would be needed to solve them. \\nOther studies have replicated this finding in many other fields. \\nExpert psychological counselors sort statements from patients accord-\\ning to the factors most relevant for choosing therapy, while novice \\ncounselors sort by superficial details. Commercial fishermen sort the \\ncreatures they haul out of the ocean by criteria with high practical \\nrelevance, such as behavior or commercial value; inexperienced fisher-\\nmen sort the creatures by appearance. In general, the knowledge of top \\nperformers is integrated and connected to higher-level principles. \\nThe same phenomena seem apparent in business. Many compa-\\nnies work hard to give their top performers the widest possible knowl- \\n96  How Deliberate Practice Works \\nedge by assigning them to many jobs that are different in nature and \\nlocation—operating jobs, staff jobs, all around the world—and in this \\nway the top performers have typically learned several, and sometimes \\nall, of the most important parts of the business. \\nIt\\'s particularly significant that many of the best-performing com-\\npanies explicitly recognize the importance of deep knowledge in their \\nspecific field, as opposed to general managerial ability. The distinction \\nis the same as the one that computer scientists were dealing with years \\nago as they tried to create the General Problem Solver; America\\'s busi-\\nness community followed much the same journey. The top business \\nschools and many of the leading companies tried for decades to turn \\nout excellent general managers, people who could land at virtually any \\norganization and whip it into shape through the sheer power of the \\ntechniques they had learned. They didn\\'t need to know much about the \\nspecific business, went the theory; they just needed to know the strate-\\ngies for solving business problems. \\nBut it turned out that wasn\\'t how management worked at many \\nof the most successful companies. When Jeff Immelt became GE\\'s \\nchief in 2001, he launched a study of the best-performing companies \\nworldwide—those that had grown much faster than the economy for \\nmany years and had produced excellent returns for shareholders. What \\ndid they have in common? One key trait the study found was that these \\ncompanies valued \"domain expertise\" in managers—extensive knowl-\\nedge of the company\\'s field. Immelt has now specified \"deep domain \\nexpertise\" as a trait required for getting ahead at GE. He explained to \\nthe Harvard Business Review: \"The most successful parts of GE are \\nplaces where leaders have stayed in place a long time. Think of Brian \\nRowe\\'s long tenure in aircraft engines. Four or five big decisions he \\nmade—relying on his deep knowledge of that business—won us maybe \\nas many as 5o years of industry leadership. The same point applies to \\nGE Capital. The places where we\\'ve churned people, like reinsurance, \\nare where you will find we\\'ve failed.\" \\n97  Talent Is Overrated \\nBuilding and developing knowledge is one of the things that delib-\\nerate practice accomplishes. Constantly trying to extend one\\'s abilities \\nin a field requires amassing additional knowledge, and staying at it for \\nyears develops the critical connections that organize all that knowledge \\nand make it useful. It must be noted, by the way, that the central im-\\nportance of knowledge to great performance poses serious difficulties \\nfor the theory that great performance arises from innate talent, since \\nno one is born with a vast fund of knowledge about anything. \\nThe crucial role of knowledge demands that great performers de-\\nvelop one other key trait. After all, what good is a ton of knowledge if \\nyou can\\'t remember it and bring it to bear at the critical moment? \\nRemembering More \\nYou\\'ll recall the description in chapter 3 of research on the memories \\nof chess players. Expert players could look for just a few seconds at a \\nchessboard with a real chess position, including as many as twenty-five \\npieces, and recall it perfectly, while novices could look at the same board \\nand recall the places of only five or so pieces; but when the chess posi-\\ntions were random, experts could recall scarcely more than the novices. \\nThe conclusion was that top-ranked chess players did not possess in-\\ncredible general memories but did possess an amazing ability to re-\\nmember real chess positions. The question that we didn\\'t address then \\nbut that begs for an answer is, how do they do it? How, specifically, are \\nthey able to remember so much? More generally, how can great per-\\nformers in every realm recall more than would seem possible? Jack \\nNicklaus in his playing days could reportedly remember every shot he \\nhad hit in every tournament. Successful businesspeople often remem-\\nber specific numbers from long-ago financial statements. Researchers \\nfind that excellent performers in most fields exhibit superior memory \\nof information in their fields. What\\'s the explanation? \\nPart of the answer came from the same research that produced \\n98  How Deliberate Practice Works \\nthat remarkable finding about the chess players. The experiment—\\npresenting a chess position for a few seconds and then asking experts \\nand novices to recall it—looked like a straightforward test of short-term \\nmemory. That\\'s the type of memory in which we hold information very \\nbriefly, and if we\\'re distracted by some other demanding task, we forget \\nwhat we were trying to remember. Many decades of research have \\nshown that average short-term memory holds only about seven items. \\nThe capacity of short-term memory doesn\\'t seem to vary much from \\nperson to person; virtually everyone\\'s short-term memory falls in the \\nrange of five to nine items. \\nAs noted, the chess researchers found that the masters possessed \\nonly average short-term memories when it came to recalling randomly \\narranged pieces. Arguably more striking was their finding that even \\nwith real chess positions, the masters had only average short-term \\nmemories in that they recalled only five to nine \"items,\" just like the \\nnovices. The difference had to be in what those \"items\" were. \\nThe researchers proposed what has become known as the chunk \\ntheory. Everyone in the experiment remembered more or less the same \\nnumber of chunks of information. For the novices, a particular piece \\non a particular square was a chunk. But for the masters, who had stud-\\nied real positions for years, a chunk was much larger, consisting of a \\nwhole group of pieces in a specific arrangement. \\nThe difference is much like the difference between letters and words. \\nImagine that you knew all the letters of the alphabet but had no idea \\nthat they could be assembled into words. Then suppose you were shown \\nfor five seconds an arrangement of letters—let\\'s say \"lexicographer\"—\\nand were asked to remember the letters in the correct order. Since you \\nwould see just a bunch of letters, you\\'d have a hard time remembering \\nmore than the first seven or so. But in reality you recognize those let-\\nters as a word you\\'re familiar with—and a thirteen-letter word at that—\\nso you can easily remember all those letters in the correct order. You \\nwouldn\\'t need to study them for the full five seconds; a half-second \\n99  Talent Is Overrated \\nwould be plenty. Though you\\'d have to think a bit, you could even re-\\npeat the whole string of letters backward. \\nWhen top-level chess players look at a board, they see words, not \\nletters. Instead of seeing twenty-five pieces, they may see just five or \\nsix groups of pieces. That\\'s why it\\'s easy for them to remember where \\nall the pieces are. The analogy can be carried further. You\\'ll recall from \\nour previous discussion of knowledge that the very best players know \\nten to a hundred times more than good club players. These chunks are \\nthe units of knowledge. Researchers estimate that good club players \\nhave a \"vocabulary\" of about 1,000 chunks, while the highest-ranked \\nplayers have a vocabulary of 10,000 to 100,000. \\nThe chunk theory is compelling and valuable, and it can be applied \\nvery widely. But as an explanation of the many remarkable memory \\nfeats of top chess players, and, by extension, of top performers in any \\nfield, it has some problems. It does fine in explaining the immediate \\nrecall of quickly presented chess positions, which are presumed to be \\nstored in short-term memory; storing larger chunks enables expert play-\\ners to overcome that type of memory\\'s inherent limits. But short-term \\nmemory—obviously—doesn\\'t last long and washes out if your mind \\nturns to something else. That\\'s why you have to write down a phone \\nnumber as soon as you hear it, and if the doorbell rings in the mean-\\ntime you\\'ve probably lost it. \\nBut now think of those chess players who play ten simultaneous \\ngames blindfolded. They can\\'t be holding all those chessboards in short-\\nterm memory because if they were, each time they turned to the next \\nboard they\\'d forget the one they were just thinking about. And they \\ncan\\'t be using long-term memory because, at least as that type of \\nmemory is conventionally defined, storing and retrieving information \\nfast enough and reliably enough to use in a chess game is not possible. \\nSo how do these expert players do it? The answer helps to explain the \\nexceptional performance not only of top chess players but also of the \\nbest doctors making diagnoses, computer programmers writing soft- \\n100  How Deliberate Practice Works \\nware, architects designing buildings, executives choosing strategies, and \\nany other excellent performer. \\nAll these people have developed what we might call a memory skill, \\na special ability to get at long-term memory, with its vast capacity, in a \\nfast, reliable way. They aren\\'t using short-term memory or traditionally \\ndefined long-term memory. The researchers who first proposed this \\nexplanation, Anders Ericsson and Walter Kintsch, called it long-term \\nworking memory. Other researchers have called it expert working \\nmemory. To understand its critical element, remember the story of SF, \\nthe yelling runner who was able to recall extraordinarily long lists of \\nrandom digits. He did it by relating the digits to numbers in forms that \\nwere meaningful to him; for example, he recalled the digits 4 1 3 1 in \\nthe form 4:13.1, a time for running the mile. He had created what\\'s \\ncalled a retrieval structure, a way of connecting the data to concepts he \\nalready possessed. \\nSF was trying only to recall digits. He had no larger objective, so he \\ncreated a retrieval structure from concepts that just happened to be \\navailable to him and had nothing to do with his task. In the real world, \\nthe great power of long-term working memory—the reason it distin-\\nguishes the best performers—is that it\\'s built on a retrieval structure \\nconnected to the very essence of the activity. Indeed, top performers\\' \\ndeep understanding of their field becomes the structure on which they \\ncan hang the huge quantities of information they learn about it. \\nTo illustrate, consider first a simple research study involving two \\ngroups: devoted baseball fans and casual observers of the game. Both \\ngroups were given an engagingly written description of a half-inning \\nof a game. Later, the devoted fans were much better able to recall the \\nevents that mattered to the game\\'s outcome—advancing runners, pre-\\nventing runs scored, and so on. The casual observers tended to remem-\\nber colorful but irrelevant details, such as the crowd\\'s mood and the \\nweather. The fans\\' high-level knowledge of the game provided a frame-\\nwork on which to hang the information they had read. \\n101  Talent Is Overrated \\nThat finding applies generally: Top performers understand their \\nfield at a higher level than average performers do, and thus have a su-\\nperior structure for remembering information about it. The best medi-\\ncal diagnosticians remember more about individual patients because \\nthey use the data to make higher-level inferences for diagnoses than \\naverage performers do. The best computer programmers are much bet-\\nter than novices at remembering the overall structure of programs \\nbecause they understand better what they\\'re intended to do and how. \\nBeginners at electronic engineering look at a circuit diagram and see \\ncomponents, while experts see major functional groups and remember \\nthem better. Rigorous research has shown all these and many more \\nexamples. \\nAs for chess players, we now see that their amazing memory is based \\non more than just an ability to perceive pieces in groups. The best play-\\ners also understand the strategic importance of each group, its role in \\nattacking, defending, and distracting the opponent, and so on. In the \\nletters-versus-words analogy, it isn\\'t just that novices see letters while \\nexperts see words; the experts also know the meanings of the words. \\nIt\\'s clear that the superior memory of great performers doesn\\'t just \\nhappen. Since it is built on deep understanding of the field, it can be \\nachieved only through years of intensive study. It further requires con-\\nsistently relating new information to higher-level concepts, which is \\nhard work. It\\'s also easy to see why experts\\' superior memory doesn\\'t \\nextend beyond their field of expertise: It is a central element of their \\nexpertise and can\\'t be separated from it. Far from being a general \\nability, it is ultimately a skill that is acquired through many years of \\ndeliberate practice. \\nWe\\'ve seen how extensive, well-structured, deliberate practice devel-\\nops the specific abilities of great performers to perceive more, know \\nmore, and remember more, and how these abilities are critical to ex-\\nceptional performance. But these aren\\'t the only ways in which practice \\n102  How Deliberate Practice Works \\nworks. It exerts an additional, overarching influence that in a way is \\neven more impressive: It can actually alter the physical nature of a \\nperson\\'s brain and body. \\nThis effect is not the obvious one in which a person\\'s muscles get \\nbigger as a result of weight training, for example, but rather involves \\ncharacteristics that most people might think couldn\\'t be changed. En-\\ndurance runners, for instance, have larger than average hearts, an at-\\ntribute that most of us see as one of the natural advantages with which \\nthey were blessed. But no, research has shown that their hearts grow \\nafter years of intensive training; when they stop training, their hearts \\nrevert toward normal size. Athletes can change not just the size of their \\nmuscles but even the composition of them (the proportion of fast-twitch \\nfibers to slow-twitch) through years of practice. Ballet dancers gain their \\nability to turn their feet out more than average people, and baseball \\npitchers their ability to extend their throwing arm farther back, through \\nextensive practice at ages before their joints calcify. \\nEven brains can be changed. When kids start practicing a musi-\\ncal instrument, their brains develop differently—the cerebral cortex \\nchanges. Brain regions that hear tones and control fingers take over \\nmore territory, and the younger the age at which a person starts prac-\\nticing, the greater the effect. The brain\\'s ability to change is greatest in \\nyouth, but it doesn\\'t end there. A study of London taxi drivers, who \\ntrain rigorously for two years on average, found that their brains had \\ngrown in the areas that govern spatial navigation. Particularly impor-\\ntant in such changes seems to be the buildup of a substance called \\nmyelin around nerve fibers and neurons, which work better with \\nmore myelin around them. The brains of professional pianists, for ex-\\nample, show increased myelination in relevant areas. \\nIt\\'s significant that myelination is a slow process. Building up myelin \\nover a nerve fiber that controls, say, hitting a particular piano key in a \\nparticular way involves sending the appropriate signal through that \\nfiber over and over. This process of building up myelin by sending \\n103  Talent Is Overrated \\nsignals through nerve fibers, which occurs in purely intellectual fields \\nlike business as well as in sports and music, needs to happen millions \\nof times in the development of a great performer. In other words, the \\nprocess of myelin development seems an exact parallel to how deliber-\\nate practice works, and illustrates in a new way why it takes many years \\nof intensive work to become a top performer. Research on myelin is \\nstill in its early stages, but it appears possible that at the most funda-\\nmental, molecular level, myelin may be the connection between intense \\npractice and great performance. \\nWe\\'ve all had the powerful feeling, when watching or contemplating \\nan extraordinary performer, that in some deep way this person is sim-\\nply not like us. Whether studying Buffett\\'s investing performance or \\nlistening to a recording of Pavarotti or watching Roger Federer hit a \\ntennis ball, we cannot find a way to relate our own performance in their \\nfields to what they do; we cannot imagine any conceivable path that \\nwould get us from here to there. That\\'s why we always fall back on the \\nsame metaphors in describing such people: They\\'re from another \\nplanet; they\\'re superhuman; they\\'re incredible. \\nWhat we\\'ve seen is that in a sense our natural reaction is right—\\ngreat performers really are fundamentally different. Their bodies and \\nbrains are actually different from ours in a profound way. In addition, \\ntheir abilities to perceive, organize, and remember information are far \\nbeyond anything that most of us possess. But we\\'re wrong in thinking, \\nas many do, that the exceptional nature of great performers is some \\nkind of eternal mystery or preordained outcome. It is, rather, the result \\nof a process, the general elements of which are clear. \\nThere is in fact a path leading from the state of our own abilities to \\nthat of the greats. The path is extremely long and demanding, and only \\na few will follow it all the way to its end. No matter how far one goes, \\nhowever, the journey is always beneficial and begins by applying the \\nelements of the process. The question, then, is how. \\n104  Chapter Seven \\nApplying the Principles in Our Lives \\nThe opportunities are many— \\nif we think about our work in a new way. \\nBenjamin Franklin was \"America\\'s first great man of letters\" in the view \\nof David Hume and many others, so we might naturally wonder how \\nhe came to be the extraordinary writer he was. His own account of it \\nin his autobiography is well known—most of us read it in school—but \\nin light of what we now know about how great performers develop, \\nseveral elements of the story seem more significant and instructive than \\nwe may have realized. \\nAs a teenager, Franklin seemed to think he wrote well enough, but \\nthen one day his father found an exchange of letters between Ben and \\na friend, John Collins, arguing a point back and forth. (The argument \\nwas whether women should be educated, Collins contending they were \\nnaturally unable to learn as much as men, Franklin taking the other \\nside.) Ben\\'s father first told his son what was good about his letters; \\nthey were better than Collins\\'s in spelling and punctuation. Then he \\ntold him and showed him specifically how they were inferior: \"in ele-\\ngance of expression, in method and in perspicuity, of which he con-\\nvinced me by several instances,\" as Franklin recalled. We must note in \\npassing that when it comes to giving people evaluations—offering \\npraise first, then supporting criticisms with examples—old Josiah \\nFranklin could be a model for us all. \\nBen responded to his father\\'s observations in several ways. First, he \\nfound examples of prose clearly superior to anything he could produce, \\n105  Talent Is Overrated \\na bound volume of the Spectator, the great English periodical written \\nby Joseph Addison and Richard Steele. Any of us might have done \\nsomething similar. But Franklin then embarked on a remarkable pro-\\ngram that few of us would ever have thought of. \\nIt began with his reading a Spectator article and making brief notes \\non the meaning of each sentence; a few days later he would take up the \\nnotes and try to express the meaning of each sentence in his own words. \\nWhen done, he compared his essay with the original, \"discovered some \\nof my faults, and corrected them.\" \\nOne of the faults he noticed was his poor vocabulary. What could he \\ndo about that? He realized that writing poetry required an extensive \\n\"stock of words\" because he might need to express any given meaning \\nin many different ways depending on the demands of rhyme or meter. \\nSo he would rewrite Spectator essays in verse. Then, after he had for-\\ngotten them, he would take his versified essays and rewrite them in \\nprose, again comparing his efforts with the original. \\nFranklin realized also that a key element of a good essay is its orga-\\nnization, so he developed a method to work on that. He would again \\nmake short notes on each sentence in an essay, but would write each \\nnote on a separate slip of paper. He would then mix up the notes and \\nset them aside for weeks, until he had forgotten the essay. At that point \\nhe would try to put the notes in their correct order, attempt to write the \\nessay, and then compare it with the original; again, he \"discovered many \\nfaults and amended them.\" \\nWhat is so striking about Franklin\\'s method is how closely it con-\\nforms to the principles of well-structured deliberate practice in the cir-\\ncumstances he faced. He did not have a teacher to guide him, but his \\nfather was able to identify some specific faults in his writing; Ben in \\neffect created his own teacher by finding examples of prose that were \\nbeyond his own abilities. He could scarcely have chosen better; Specta-\\ntor essays were exactly the type of engaging, topical, innovative writing \\nio6  Applying the Principles in Our Lives \\nthat Franklin wanted to produce, and they were so good that the volume \\nhe studied is still widely available almost three hundred years later. So \\nFranklin identified the aspects of his performance that needed to be \\nimproved and found a way to stretch himself, the essential core of de-\\nliberate practice. \\nSignificantly, he did not try to become a better essay writer by sitting \\ndown and writing essays. Instead, like a top-ranked athlete or musician, \\nhe worked over and over on those specific aspects that needed improve-\\nment. First came sentence structure, which he attacked precisely in ac-\\ncord with deliberate practice principles. His method of summarizing \\nand reformulating Spectator sentences one by one was designed inge-\\nniously for that purpose. He repeated this routine at high volume, there \\nbeing lots of sentences in an essay, and he got immediate feedback by \\ncomparing his sentences with the original. When he decided to work \\non another element of performance, vocabulary, he again designed a \\nbrilliant practice structure, versification, with high volume and imme-\\ndiate feedback. Note also that since he eventually converted his rhym-\\ning essays back into prose, he was continuing to work on sentence \\nstructure. His approach to a third element, organization, was again ex-\\ntremely clever in allowing him to stretch himself repeatedly on that \\nspecific skill while also maintaining the others. \\nOne further feature of Franklin\\'s approach to better writing is im-\\nportant to note. He pursued it diligently. When people today hear about \\nwhat he did, they generally marvel not at the brilliance of his practice \\ndesign but at his ability to carry it through. It seems like so much work. \\nThe truth is that in theory anyone could have followed his routine; any-\\none still can, and it would be highly effective. But nobody does it, not \\neven students who are studying writing. And Franklin was not a \\nstudent. He was then an apprentice in his brother\\'s printing business, \\na demanding job that left him little free time. He practiced writing be-\\nfore work in the morning, after work at night, and on Sunday, \"when I \\n107  Talent Is Overrated \\ncontrived to be in the printing-house alone.\" Raised as a Puritan, he \\nknew he was supposed to be in church on Sunday, but \"I could not, as \\nit seemed to me, afford time\" to go. \\nThe details of how Franklin taught himself to write well are worth \\nour attention for two reasons. First, they provide a particularly clear \\nexample of how deliberate practice works—in this case how it helped \\nform one of the most effective and influential writers of English prose \\nof his era. Second, they\\'re an inspiring illustration of how to apply these \\nprinciples on one\\'s own in circumstances far from ideal—which unfor-\\ntunately are just the circumstances in which most people in companies \\nand many other organizations find themselves today. \\nWe saw earlier how hostile to the principles of well-structured de-\\nliberate practice most companies seem. That\\'s all the more puzzling \\nwhen you consider how many high-profile organizations apart from \\nbusinesses embrace these principles. We\\'re awed by the performances \\nof champion sports teams or great orchestras and theater companies, \\nbut when we get to the office, it occurs to practically no one that we \\nmight have something to learn by studying how some people became \\nso accomplished. The U.S. military has made itself far more effective \\nby studying and adopting these principles, and it funds some of the \\nmost important research in this field. But at most companies—as well \\nas most educational institutions and many nonprofit organizations—\\nthe fundamentals of great performance are mainly unrecognized or \\nignored. \\nThat\\'s the reality at most organizations, though not all. We\\'ll see in \\nthe next chapter how some organizations apply these ideas in diverse \\nways, and how they could do so even more. But since most organiza-\\ntions don\\'t understand or apply these principles, and since most people \\naren\\'t in a position to change how their employer operates, we\\'ll look \\nfirst at what individuals can do on their own, like Ben Franklin, to be-\\ncome much better in their fields. \\n108  Applying the Principles in Our Lives \\nKnow Where You Want to Go \\nStep one, obvious yet deserving a moment\\'s consideration, is knowing \\nwhat you want to do. The key word is not what, but knowing. Because \\nthe demands of achieving exceptional performance are so great over \\nso many years, no one has a prayer of meeting them without utter com-\\nmitment. You\\'ve got to know what you want to do, not suspect it or be \\ninclined toward it or be thinking about it. In the final chapter we\\'ll look \\nmore closely into the mysterious question of where that commitment \\ncomes from. For now we\\'ll assume that you\\'re settled on what you want \\nto achieve, even if it\\'s only the next step in a general direction. \\nThe first challenge in designing a system of deliberate practice is \\nidentifying the immediate next steps. In a few fields those steps are \\nclear. If you want to play the piano, the exact skills you must learn and \\nthe order in which to learn them have been worked out by many gen-\\nerations of teachers. It\\'s similar in highly structured professions; at least \\nthe initial steps in becoming an accountant, lawyer, or doctor are well \\nestablished, and you have teachers to guide you. \\nBut in the great majority of careers, and in the advanced stages of all \\nof them, there is no published curriculum, no syllabus of materials that \\nmust be studied and mastered. In deciding which skills and abilities to \\nwork on, and how to do it, you\\'re on your own. Most of us are completely \\nunqualified to figure these things out by ourselves; we need help. \\nFrom this perspective we can see mentors in a new way—not just \\nas wise people to whom we turn for guidance, but as experienced mas-\\nters in our field who can advise us on the skills and abilities we need \\nto acquire next, and can give us feedback on how we\\'re doing. At least \\nthat\\'s the ideal mentor, ideally used. Finding such a person isn\\'t easy, \\nbut it\\'s always possible to pursue the general principle: In all practice \\nactivities it\\'s highly valuable to get others\\' views about what you should \\nbe working on and how you\\'re doing. \\n109  Talent Is Overrated \\nThe skills and abilities one can choose to develop are infinite, but \\nthe opportunities to practice them fall into two general categories: op-\\nportunities to practice directly, apart from the actual use of the skill or \\nability, the way a musician practices a piece before performing it; and \\nopportunities to practice as part of the work itself. \\nPracticing Directly \\nIn most jobs the notion of practicing directly is not well established, \\naside from maybe rehearsing a speech. But in fact the possibilities are \\nsurprisingly wide and deep. We can think of them in three general cat-\\negories, based on models used in fields in which practice is accepted as \\ncritically important. \\nThe music model. \\nIn the classical tradition, a musician knows what he or she is going to \\nplay; the music is written down. What separates the greats from the \\nrest is how well they perform that music. In business we find many \\nanalogous situations, far more than you might at first think. The most \\nobvious involve presentations and speeches, and these form the one \\nelement of corporate life that is commonly practiced. But how well? \\nThese events can be extraordinarily important—a presentation to Wall \\nStreet analysts, to the board of directors, to your boss, to a congressio-\\nnal committee, or just to immediate colleagues can hold large conse-\\nquences for you or your organization. Yet for most people, practice \\nconsists of perhaps a few run-throughs. \\nThink of all the ways it could be done much better. One could ana-\\nlyze the text of the talk and in each section determine the most impor-\\ntant idea to be conveyed—passion, logical inevitability, common bonds \\nwith the audience, humor—and then work on each section repeatedly, \\nconstantly striving to express that key idea more effectively, with feed-\\nback after each repetition, either from a coach or by watching video. In \\n110  Applying the Principles in Our Lives \\nthe age of YouTube, it may be easy to find video of others giving similar \\ntypes of presentations that one can then analyze and learn from, not-\\ning specifically how other speakers tried—well or badly—to convey the \\nsame key ideas that you want to put across. \\nIs this way more work than anyone you know has ever put into a \\npresentation? Most likely. But it is exactly the type of preparation that \\ngreat performers put into whatever they do. \\nMany other important elements of business life can be practiced \\nsimilarly. One of the most dreaded tasks for many managers is giving \\njob evaluations to their direct reports. This is a music-model task; you \\nknow what you want to convey, and the challenge is to convey it effec-\\ntively. The message can be broken down into pieces and each piece ana-\\nlyzed for intent, then practiced repeatedly with immediate feedback \\nfrom a coach or by video. Even being interviewed—by a prospective \\nemployer or by the news media—can be practiced in this way. After all, \\nin those situations you probably know the key messages that you intend \\nto convey, regardless of the questions you\\'re asked. \\nWe have bypassed the question of how these presentations or \\nspeeches get written. It\\'s often said that anything you write is a perfor-\\nmance, which suggests that writing may be considered a music-model \\nactivity. For straightforward written work, the multipart Ben Franklin \\ntechnique would be appropriate; instead of emulating the Spectator, \\nyou would choose a superior letter to the shareholders, advertisement, \\nblog entry, or other appropriate model. For spoken presentations, a par-\\nticularly effective approach would be a juiced-up Ben Franklin tech-\\nnique: Watch a presentation that you consider especially well done and \\nmake notes of its various points; later, after you\\'ve forgotten most of it, \\nuse your notes to create a talk making the same points; deliver the talk \\nand record it; then compare your video with the original. \\n111  Talent Is Overrated \\nThe chess model. \\nExcellent chess players practice by studying positions from real games \\nbetween top-level players, organized by various themes—openings, end-\\ngames, attacks, defenses, and many other categories that are far more \\nrefined. Thousands of books of such positions have been published. \\nThe practice routine is to study a particular position and choose the \\nmove you would make, then compare it with the move chosen by the \\nmaster; if they\\'re different, figure out why and which is better. \\nThis is practice of a different type, but it still fulfills the requirements \\nof well-structured deliberate practice: It is designed to meet the central \\ndemands of the field, in this case move selection, and can be further \\nfocused on the types of moves that need to be improved; and it involves \\nhigh repetition and immediate feedback. Many elements of job perfor-\\nmance can be improved through a similar approach. \\nIn fact, the chess model has been used widely in business education \\nfor eighty years, but under a different name: the case method. Pio-\\nneered at the Harvard Business School, it is strongly analogous to chess \\npractice: You\\'re presented with a problem, and your job is to figure out \\na solution. Real life being the way it is, you often won\\'t know whether \\nthe solution chosen by the case\\'s protagonist was the best one possible, \\nor whether yours was any better. But the process of focusing on the \\nproblem and evaluating proposed solutions is powerfully instructive, \\nwhich helps explain why the case method is used by hundreds of uni-\\nversities around the world. \\nOne of the great strengths of this approach is that it can be focused \\nsharply on specific skills that need improvement, in keeping with de-\\nliberate practice principles. You might work in marketing for years and \\nget only a couple of chances to market U.S. products in China, for ex-\\nample, so that\\'s a skill you probably wouldn\\'t be very good at. But in a \\nshort time you could study a dozen cases about marketing U.S. products \\n112  Applying the Principles in Our Lives \\nin China. That\\'s one step removed from actually marketing the prod-\\nucts, but it puts you many steps ahead of anyone who has not studied \\nthat specific skill intensely and repeatedly. \\nOne way to apply the chess model is to take business classes that use \\nthe case method. That option isn\\'t always available, but it holds many \\nadvantages. Since the correct response to the case problem isn\\'t always \\nclear, it\\'s helpful to hear the perspectives of other students and espe-\\ncially of the teacher, who may be the writer of the case. Classes also \\ntypically expose students to a lot of cases; students at the Harvard Busi-\\nness School study more than five hundred of them during the two-year \\nprogram. \\nIf you can\\'t go to business school or take business classes, you can \\nstill apply the chess model ad hoc. For starters, many of the case studies \\nused at famous business schools worldwide are for sale; you can buy \\nthem online and study them yourself. More generally, consciousness of \\nthe chess model changes the way you read the news or observe what \\nhappens in your own industry or the company where you work. The \\nessence of the chess model is the question: What would you do? Each \\nnews event that you read about, each new development in your com-\\npany or industry, is an opportunity for you to answer that question. Oil \\nprices jump, consumer spending tanks, a rogue trader loses $7 billion, \\nApple introduces the iPhone—don\\'t just read the news, imagine how \\nit might affect the business you\\'re in or want to be in, and answer the \\nquestion: What would you do? Then comes a critically important step: \\nWrite your answer down and keep it. Remember, feedback is crucial to \\neffective practice, and people have a tendency to misremember what \\nthey thought in the past; we almost always adjust our recollections flat-\\nteringly, in light of how events actually turned out. But there\\'s no escap-\\ning a written record. Comparing your own what-would-I-do with the \\nresults of what the protagonist really did is the only way this exercise \\ncan yield genuine learning, and that learning can be considerable. \\n113  Talent Is Overrated \\nThe sports model. \\nThe practice of top athletes falls into two large categories. One is con-\\nditioning, building the strengths and capacities that are most useful in \\na given sport. NFL linemen build their leg muscles in a way that pro-\\nduces explosive power; tennis players work on stamina so they can still \\nget to the ball three hours into a match. The other category of practice \\nis working on specific critical skills—batting a baseball, throwing a \\nfootball, hitting a golf ball out of the sand. A characteristic that many \\nof these skills share is that they must be performed differently every \\ntime because the situations in which they\\'re encountered are never the \\nsame. That\\'s why this is different from the music model. For a pianist, \\nthe notes in Beethoven\\'s Moonlight Sonata never change, but for a quarter-\\nback, no two passing situations are ever alike. \\nWhat are the analogs in business? For conditioning, we\\'ll assume \\nthat your work makes no significant physical demands; if it does, the \\nappropriate physical conditioning opportunities will be apparent. But \\nif your work is information- and service-based, as most work in the de-\\nveloped world is, then conditioning means getting stronger with the \\nunderlying cognitive skills that you probably already have—basic math \\nand accounting in financial jobs, basic science in engineering jobs, basic \\nlanguage skills in editorial jobs. In many cases this is stuff you learned \\nin high school or college, and it\\'s tempting to think you couldn\\'t possi-\\nbly benefit from revisiting it. But the truth is that these strengths, like \\nphysical strengths, decay if they aren\\'t maintained. \\nConditioning in this context can take various forms. It can mean get-\\nting out those old textbooks or handbooks and reviewing the funda-\\nmental skills that underlie your work, becoming faster, more facile, and \\nmore confident with them. For example, no matter how long you\\'ve \\nworked in the world of investments, you will benefit from rereading \\nGraham and Dodd\\'s Security Analysis, a book you probably got when \\nyou started; and I guarantee you will learn something important that \\n114  Applying the Principles in Our Lives \\nyou\\'d forgotten. For people who write and edit, the same applies to \\nFowler\\'s Modern English Usage and Strunk and White\\'s The Elements \\nof Style. Every field has classic guides that will always repay study, just \\nas linebackers will always benefit from leg presses. The difference is \\nthat every linebacker from high school on up to the NFL does leg \\npresses, while surprisingly few people in business practice the basic \\nconditioning that supports all they do. \\nConditioning can also be practiced with new material. Analyze the \\nbasic ratios in an unfamiliar financial statement with pen and paper, \\neven though you have software that could do it all with one click. Do a \\nvalue-based analysis of a stock. Pencil-edit a magazine article. You won\\'t \\nbe learning new skills; you\\'ll be building the strengths that make all \\nyour skills possible. \\nThe second type of practice in the sports model, specific skill devel-\\nopment, is based on focused simulation, and that concept can be ap-\\nplied widely in business, though doing it by oneself may be a challenge. \\nAthletes spend much of their time working on particular skills that \\naren\\'t like playing a piece of written music, which doesn\\'t change, or \\nlike certain sports skills that are entirely under the athlete\\'s control, \\nsuch as pitching a baseball or serving a tennis ball. These other skills \\nare difficult in part because they have one or both of two traits. First, \\nthey may require a fast response to an unpredictable action by the \\nopponent—hitting a baseball or returning a tennis serve, for example. \\nSecond, they may be fluid and dynamic; a pass receiver may not be \\nopen when the quarterback throws the ball but may be by the time the \\nball arrives. \\nUnpredictable opponents, fast responses, dynamic situations—how \\nvery much like life in business. Practicing these situations can be diffi-\\ncult on your own because by their nature they involve other people. If \\nyou can get someone to help you practice a sales call or a negotiation, \\nfor example, by all means do so, being sure to remember the princi-\\nples: trying to improve a specific aspect of your performance, high \\n115  Talent Is Overrated \\nrepetition, immediate feedback. But if you can\\'t get anyone to help, you \\ncan do a great deal of this type of practice by yourself through the fast-\\ngrowing world of business simulations. It\\'s quite amazing what\\'s avail-\\nable. Web-based or downloadable simulation games in marketing, stock \\ntrading, negotiating, corporate strategizing, and many other disciplines \\nat several levels of sophistication are widely available, with more being \\ncreated every day. They are a genuine advance in making this valuable \\ntype of practice easy and accessible. \\nPracticing in the Work \\nOpportunities to practice business skills directly are far more available \\nthan we usually realize, but even these aren\\'t the only opportunities. \\nWe all face a different way to practice business skills, and that is by \\nfinding practice in the work itself. It is, to repeat, a different kind of ac-\\ntivity. If you\\'re holding a talk with your boss about your bonus target, \\nyou probably can\\'t say, \"Hold on—let\\'s discuss that point five more \\ntimes.\" But in that or any other situation you can do different things \\nthat will help make you much better. And they\\'re all done in your \\nhead. \\nResearchers call these activities self-regulation. That term encom-\\npasses a broad range of behaviors, some of which are highly relevant \\nhere. Professor Barry J. Zimmerman, of City University of New York, \\nand colleagues have studied these behaviors extensively, and he finds \\nthat the \"properties of deliberate practice . . . have been studied as key \\ncomponents of self-regulation.\" Effective self-regulation is something \\nyou do before, during, and after the work activity itself. \\nBefore the work. \\nSelf-regulation begins with setting goals. These are not big, life-directing \\ngoals, but instead are more immediate goals for what you\\'re going to \\nbe doing today. In the research, the poorest performers don\\'t set goals \\n116  Applying the Principles in Our Lives \\nat all; they just slog through their work. Mediocre performers set goals \\nthat are general and are often focused on simply achieving a good \\noutcome—win the order; close out my positions at a profit; get the new \\nproject proposal done. The best performers set goals that are not about \\nthe outcome but about the process of reaching the outcome. For exam-\\nple, instead of just winning the order, their goal might be to focus es-\\npecially hard on discerning the customer\\'s unstated needs. \\nYou can see how this is strongly analogous to the first step of delib-\\nerate practice. It isn\\'t precisely the same; you are not designing a prac-\\ntice activity, but rather doing whatever the requirements of work \\nmay demand of you that day. But within that activity, the best perform-\\ners are focused on how they can get better at some specific element \\nof the work, just as a pianist may focus on improving a particular \\npassage. \\nWith a goal set, the next prework step is planning how to reach \\nthe goal. Again, the best performers make the most specific, technique-\\noriented plans. They\\'re thinking of exactly, not vaguely, how to get to \\nwhere they\\'re going. So if their goal is discerning the customer\\'s un-\\nstated needs, their plan for achieving it on that day may be to listen for \\ncertain key words the customer might use, or to ask specific questions \\nto bring out the customer\\'s crucial issues. \\nAn important part of prework self-regulation centers on attitudes \\nand beliefs. You may be thinking that figuring out specific goals and \\nplans for what you\\'ll be doing every day sounds hard. It is, and doing \\nit consistently requires high motivation. Where does it come from? The \\nbest performers go into their work with a powerful belief in what re-\\nsearchers call their self-efficacy—their ability to perform. They also \\nbelieve strongly that all their work will pay off for them. \\nDuring the work. \\nThe most important self-regulatory skill that top performers use during \\ntheir work is self-observation. For example, ordinary endurance runners \\n117  Talent Is Overrated \\nin a race tend to think about anything other than what they\\'re doing; \\nit\\'s painful, and they want to take their minds off it. Elite runners, by \\ncontrast, focus intensely on themselves; among other things, they count \\ntheir breaths and simultaneously count their strides in order to main-\\ntain certain ratios. \\nMost of us don\\'t do work with a significant physical element, but the \\nsame principle applies in purely mental work. The best performers ob-\\nserve themselves closely. They are in effect able to step outside them-\\nselves, monitor what is happening in their own minds, and ask how it\\'s \\ngoing. Researchers call this metacognition—knowledge about your own \\nknowledge, thinking about your own thinking. Top performers do this \\nmuch more systematically than others do; it\\'s an established part of \\ntheir routine. \\nMetacognition is important because situations change as they play \\nout. Apart from its role in finding opportunities for practice, it plays a \\nvaluable part in helping top performers adapt to changing conditions. \\nWhen a customer raises a completely unexpected problem in a deal \\nnegotiation, an excellent businessperson can pause mentally and ob-\\nserve his or her own mental processes as if from outside: Have I fully \\nunderstood what\\'s really behind this objection? Am I angry? Am I \\nbeing hijacked by my emotions? Do I need a different strategy here? \\nWhat should it be? \\nIn addition, metacognition helps top performers find practice oppor-\\ntunities in evolving situations. Such people can observe their own think-\\ning and ask: What abilities are being taxed in this situation? Can I try \\nout another skill here? Could I be pushing myself a little further? How \\nis it working? Through their ability to observe themselves, they can si-\\nmultaneously do what they\\'re doing and practice what they\\'re doing. \\nAfter the work. \\nPractice activities are worthless without useful feedback about the re- \\nsults. Similarly, the practice opportunities that we find in work won\\'t \\n118  Applying the Principles in Our Lives \\ndo any good if we don\\'t evaluate them afterward. These must be self-\\nevaluations; because the practice activities took place in our own minds, \\nonly we can know fully what we were attempting or judge how it \\nturned out. \\nExcellent performers judge themselves differently from the way \\nother people do. They\\'re more specific, just as they are when they set \\ngoals and strategies. Average performers are content to tell themselves \\nthat they did great or poorly or okay. The best performers judge them-\\nselves against a standard that\\'s relevant for what they\\'re trying to \\nachieve. Sometimes they compare their performance with their own \\npersonal best; sometimes they compare with the performance of com-\\npetitors they\\'re facing or expect to face; sometimes they compare \\nwith the best known performance by anyone in the field. Any of those \\ncan make sense; the key, as in all deliberate practice, is to choose a com-\\nparison that stretches you just beyond your current limits. Research \\nconfirms what common sense tells us, that too high a standard is dis-\\ncouraging and not very instructive, while too low a standard produces \\nno advancement. \\nIf you were pushing yourself appropriately and have evaluated your-\\nself rigorously, then you will have identified errors that you made. A \\ncritical part of self-evaluation is deciding what caused the errors. Aver-\\nage performers believe their errors were caused by factors outside their \\ncontrol: My opponent got lucky; the task was too hard; I just don\\'t have \\nany natural ability for this. Top performers, by contrast, believe they \\nare responsible for their errors. Note that this is not just a difference of \\npersonality or attitude. Recall that the best performers have set highly \\nspecific, technique-based goals and strategies for themselves; they have \\nthought through exactly how they intend to achieve what they want. \\nSo when something doesn\\'t work, they can relate the failure to specific \\nelements of their performance that may have misfired. Research on \\nchampion golfers, for example, has uncovered precisely this pattern. \\nThey\\'re much less likely than average golfers to blame their problems \\n119  Talent Is Overrated \\non the weather, the course, or chance factors. Instead they focus relent-\\nlessly on their own performance. \\nThe final element of the postwork phase is affected by all the others \\nand affects them in turn. You\\'ve been through some kind of work \\nexperience—a meeting with your team, a trading session, a quarterly \\nbudget review, a customer visit. You had thought about what you \\nwanted to achieve and to improve, and it went however it went. Now: \\nHow do you respond? Odds are strong that the experience wasn\\'t per-\\nfect, that parts of it were unpleasant. In those cases, excellent perform-\\ners respond by adapting the way they act; average performers respond \\nby avoiding those situations in the future. That stands to reason. Aver-\\nage performers go into a situation with no clear idea of how they intend \\nto act or how their actions would contribute to reaching their goal. So \\nwhen things don\\'t turn out perfectly, they attribute the problems to \\nvague forces outside their control. As a result, they are clueless about \\nhow to adapt and perform better next time. Little wonder that they\\'d \\nrather just avoid going through anything like it again, which of course \\nmeans they have zero chance of getting any better. \\nSince excellent performers go through a sharply different process \\nfrom the beginning, they can make good guesses about how to adapt. \\nThat is, their ideas for how to perform better next time are likely to \\nwork. So it\\'s hardly surprising that they are more likely than average \\nperformers to repeat the experience rather than avoid it. And when \\nthey do repeat it, we can now understand why they go into it with some \\nof the prework traits and attitudes we observed: They approach the job \\nwith more specific goals and strategies, since their previous experience \\nwas essentially a test of specific goals and strategies; and they\\'re more \\nlikely to believe in their own efficacy because their detailed analysis of \\ntheir own performance is more effective than the vague, unfocused \\nanalysis of average performers. Thus their well-founded belief in their \\nown effectiveness helps give them the crucial motivation to press on, \\npowering a self-reinforcing cycle. \\n120  Applying the Principles in Our Lives \\nDeepening Your Knowledge \\nIn addition to finding opportunities to practice skills directly as well as \\nin the midst of their work, people in the business world can pursue one \\nmore category of activities that utilize the principles of great perfor-\\nmance to get better at what they do. We\\'ve seen how deep domain \\nknowledge is fundamental to top-level performance. You don\\'t have to \\nwait for that knowledge to come your way in the course of your work. \\nYou can pursue it. \\nIt\\'s crazy that in most jobs and at most organizations, there\\'s little \\nor no explicit education about the nature of the domain. Engineers, \\nlawyers, accountants, and others go to school to learn the skills of their \\nprofession, but when it comes to the company, the industry, financial \\nrelationships, and how the business works, most people assume they\\'ll \\njust pick up what they need to know, and most organizations agree. In \\nreality, maybe you\\'ll pick up what you need to know or maybe you \\nwon\\'t. But in light of the critical importance of domain knowledge, it\\'s \\nobvious that this offhand approach to acquiring that knowledge makes \\nno sense. \\nImagine the difference if you made domain knowledge a direct ob-\\njective rather than a byproduct of work. If you set a goal of becoming \\nan expert on your business, you would immediately start doing all kinds \\nof things you don\\'t do now. You would study the history of the business, \\nidentify today\\'s leading experts, read everything you could find, inter-\\nview people inside your organization and outside it who could provide \\nnew perspectives, track key statistics and trends. The exact steps would \\nvary depending on your business, but it\\'s quickly apparent that you \\ncould make yourself impressively more knowledgeable about your busi-\\nness than you are today, and probably do so in short order. With time, \\nyour knowledge advantage over others would become large. \\nThe opportunity is richer than you may suspect. Michael Porter, the \\nHarvard Business School professor who is one of the all-time great \\n121  Talent Is Overrated \\nauthorities on corporate strategy, prepares rigorously for his consulting \\nassignments by studying the client company and its industry. He once \\nsaid that with twenty hours of library research (this was pre-Internet) \\nhe could know as much about the business as the CEO did. Of course \\nPorter has spent many years learning what data to look for, so maybe \\nit would take you forty hours. That still looks like a high-return invest-\\nment. Imagine what an advantage you would hold by gaining such \\nknowledge, especially if your employer, like most, doesn\\'t educate em-\\nployees explicitly in the most important information about the com-\\npany and industry. \\nAs you add to your knowledge of your domain, keep in mind that \\nyour objective is not just to amass information. You are building a men-\\ntal model—a picture of how your domain functions as a system. This \\nis one of the defining traits of great performers: They all possess large, \\nhighly developed, intricate mental models of their domains. \\nThe principle applies to all fields that are complex and demanding—\\ncorporate strategy, medicine, politics, and a great many others. For \\nexample, your mental model of the domain of driving, while adequate \\nfor your purposes, is probably quite sparse. You have a general under-\\nstanding of how the car works, you\\'re highly familiar with a few well-\\ntraveled routes, and you pay a bit of attention to gas prices. But a \\ntop-performing truck driver possesses an extremely rich mental model \\nof the same domain. He understands in detail all the subsystems of his \\nvehicle—mechanical, hydraulic, electrical—and how they interact. He \\nknows hundreds of routes and their features, including speed limits, \\nroad conditions, service facilities, weight limits, weighing stations, po-\\nlice activity, gas prices, state licensing requirements, and many others. \\nMost important, he understands the subtle ways in which all these shift-\\ning factors combine to influence his profitability. \\nFor anyone, a rich mental model contributes to great performance \\nin three major ways: \\n122  Applying the Principles in Our Lives \\nA mental model forms the framework on which you hang your \\ngrowing knowledge of your domain. \\nWe\\'ve seen how top performers can reach into their long-term memory \\nin ways that ordinary performers can\\'t, and how it isn\\'t because they \\nhave exceptional memories but because they have exceptional knowl-\\nedge of their domain. The organization of that voluminous knowledge \\nin a mental model is what gives it so much power. A mental model not \\nonly enables remarkable recall, it also helps top performers learn and \\nunderstand new information better than average performers, since they \\nsee it not as an isolated bit of data but as part of a large and compre-\\nhensible picture. For instance, an ordinary accountant might see a par-\\nticular recent accounting rule change—Financial Accounting Statement \\n157—which requires companies to measure the riskiness of their assets \\nin new ways, as a big, complicated pain in the neck that amends or de-\\nletes portions of forty-seven other statements. But a top accountant sees \\nthe change as part of a broad, post-Enron shift toward more detailed \\nrisk assessment, and understands who it helps, who it hurts, and why \\nit was made. \\nA mental model helps you distinguish relevant information from \\nirrelevant information. \\nThat ability is valuable when you encounter new factors in a situation \\nbecause it frees up mental resources to work on what\\'s really important. \\nIn a study, top-performing pilots and apprentices listened to recordings \\nof air-traffic control radio communications, and then were asked to \\nrecall what they heard. The apprentices actually recalled more of \\nthe \"filler\" words that had no practical significance than the top pilots \\ndid. But the expert pilots recalled far more of the important concept \\nwords. Because they heard the communications as part of a rich mental \\nmodel, they could focus their brainpower on what counted. \\n123  Talent Is Overrated \\nMost important, a mental model enables you to project \\nwhat will happen next. \\nSince your mental model is an understanding of how your domain \\nfunctions as a system, you know how changes in the system\\'s inputs \\nwill affect the outputs—that is, how the events that just happened \\nwill create the events that are about to happen. Two groups of fire-\\nfighters, novices and experts, were shown scenes of fires and asked \\nwhat they saw. The novices saw what was obvious—the intensity \\nand color of the flames. But the experts saw a story; they used their \\nmental models to infer what must have led to the current state of the \\nfire and to predict what was likeliest to happen next. Note that these \\ninferences and predictions are more than just interesting. They are \\nevidence that the experts are far better prepared than the novices to \\nfight the fire. \\nA mental model is never finished. Great performers not only possess \\nhighly developed mental models, they are also always expanding and \\nrevising those models. It isn\\'t possible to do the whole job through \\nstudy alone. In many fields, much of this work must be done through \\ndeliberate practice activities or through metacognitive processes in \\nthe work itself, as we\\'ve discussed. But in addition, significant build-\\ning and enriching of mental models can be done through study and \\nother knowledge seeking, and it would be foolish to leave these tools \\nunused. \\nYou  can do a great deal as an individual to apply the principles of great \\nperformance in your own life and work. Applying these principles is \\nalways beneficial. No matter how many steps on the road to great per-\\nformance you choose to take, you will be better off than if you hadn\\'t \\ntaken them. There is no hurdle to clear before the advantages start ac-\\ncruing. This is pure opportunity. \\n124  Applying the Principles in Our Lives \\nThat\\'s for you as an individual. Chances are you work in an organi-\\nzation. To really turbocharge the benefits of deliberate practice, the \\nprinciples need to be applied organizationally as well as individually. \\nIt can be done, and the fact that it isn\\'t done very widely makes the \\nopportunity all the more valuable. That\\'s our next topic.  Chapter Eight \\nApplying the Principles in Our Organizations \\nFew do it well, and most don\\'t do it at all; \\nthe sooner you start, the better. \\nNot all organizations want to be great. That\\'s the hard truth. For those \\nthat do—that really do—the principles of great performance show \\nquite clearly what it takes to get there. And for those enterprises that \\nare paddling hard just to stay afloat, whose owners and managers may \\nnot feel they\\'ve got the luxury of thinking grandiose thoughts about \\ngreatness, these same principles can help make their performance much \\nbetter. In fact, the principles of great performance can help improve \\nsuch organizations to the point where they might actually dare to think \\nabout greatness. That is, the principles can do this if they\\'re applied. \\nYet the great majority of organizations don\\'t apply these principles. \\nIn today\\'s economy, that fact is more than just an opportunity. Apply-\\ning the principles is becoming an imperative for all organizations that \\nwant to survive. We\\'ve seen in chapter i how the economy is increas-\\ningly based not on financial capital but on human capital, and how the \\nabilities of the people in an organization—much more than tradition-\\nally important factors like economies of scale or patent protections—\\ndetermine an enterprise\\'s success or failure. And we\\'ve seen that, in a \\nglobal economy, standards of performance are rising more quickly and \\nmore broadly than ever before, leaving subpar performers no place to \\nhide. Those are reasons enough for organizations to start applying the \\nprinciples of great performance in a big way. But there\\'s more. \\n126  Applying the Principles in Our Organizations \\nToday\\'s best young employees, the ones on whom future success \\nwill depend, are demanding that employers help make them better \\nperformers. It seems that young people understood the new nature \\nof today\\'s economy before a lot of CEOs did, and they insist on em-\\nployers who will keep developing them. Judy Pahren, senior vice \\npresident for development and diversity at Capital One Financial, \\nwhich does a good job of applying the principles of great performance, \\nsays new employees consistently put continuous professional de-\\nvelopment at or near the top of their criteria for choosing an em-\\nployer. Many other human resources chiefs report the same finding \\n(and they all report that money is never among the top three cri-\\nteria). General Electric, the best major company at applying the prin-\\nciples of great performance organizationally, is responding to the \\nnew environment by, among other things, getting high-potential \\nemployees to the company\\'s famed Crotonville leadership develop-\\nment center much earlier in their careers than previously; CEO Jeff \\nImmelt says that in attracting top prospects, \"that\\'s a strong selling \\npoint.\" \\nHow the Best Organizations Apply the \\nPrinciples of Great Performance \\nOrganizations are finding that the advantages of building a big reputa-\\ntion for developing people are even greater than they may have thought. \\nSuch a reputation grants these companies \"a first-pick advantage,\" as \\nthe RBL Group consulting firm calls it, an edge in attracting the cream \\nof college and business-school students. By continually attracting the \\nmost promising graduates, and then developing them further, these \\ncompanies become even higher-performing organizations, further en-\\nhancing their ability to attract the best—a virtuous cycle that makes a \\ncompany more dominant every year. \\n127  Talent Is Overrated \\nThe elite group of organizations that apply the principles of great \\nperformance follow several major rules. \\nUnderstand that each person in the organization is not just doing \\na job, but is also being stretched and grown. \\nThat is, the best organizations assign people to jobs in much the same \\nway that sports coaches or music teachers choose exercises for their \\nstudents—to push them just beyond their current capabilities and build \\nthe skills that are most important. John Lechleiter, president of Eli Lilly, \\ndescribes a typical model: about two-thirds of people development \\ncomes from carefully chosen job assignments, about one-third from \\nmentoring and coaching (which we\\'ll examine more closely), and a \\nsmidgen from classroom training. \\nBuilding people through job assignments seems obvious in theory, \\nbut in practice it\\'s tough. Organizations tend to assign people based on \\nwhat they\\'re already good at, not what they need to work on. The mer-\\nciless competitive pressure on every company makes it difficult to pull \\naccomplished employees out of jobs they do extremely well and put \\nthem into positions where they may struggle. That\\'s a tension every \\norganization must deal with in order to become more successful. \\nNo company assembles careers on the principles of great perfor-\\nmance better than GE. It holds an advantage over most firms, since \\nits breadth of businesses lets it offer a wider range of experiences \\nthan almost any other company. It uses that advantage for all it\\'s worth \\nto create some of the world\\'s best-rounded and most sought after \\nexecutives. \\nOne of GE\\'s secret developmental weapons, an example of the useful \\nassignments it can hand out, is the job of running GE Transportation, \\nthe business that makes locomotives in Erie, Pennsylvania. Consider \\nall the ways in which it can stretch a manager: Buying locomotives is \\na big decision for the business\\'s customers, so the person running the \\nshop—recently John Dineen, a twenty-one-year GE employee—gets ex- \\n128  Applying the Principles in Our Organizations \\nperience dealing directly with CEOs of customer companies. The busi-\\\\ \\nness is unionized, so he learns about labor negotiations. The product is \\ncomplex, as is the supply chain—more learning that\\'s broadly applica-\\nble. Erie is sufficiently remote and unglamorous that the business leader \\ncan develop without national media scrutiny. And if, heaven forbid, the \\nleader is a washout, GE is big enough to handle the trouble without \\nmuch trauma to the bottom line. \\nDineen\\'s prelocomotive career is a typical example of what GE can \\ndo and many other organizations strive for. He was a manager in the \\ncompany\\'s appliance and plastics businesses, both highly valued devel-\\nopmental posts, one of which makes consumer products and the other \\nindustrial products; he has worked in a couple of finance assignments, \\nwhich also develop skills that are very important at GE; and he has held \\ntwo large jobs in Asia, one staff and one line. You can\\'t do much better \\nthan that. \\nDeliberately putting managers into stretch jobs that will require \\nthem to learn and grow is the central development technique of the \\nmost successful organizations. It won\\'t work by itself; it requires the \\nother practices described here to be effective. But these companies un-\\nderstand that for employees trying to improve, making real decisions \\nin real time is the central practice activity that produces growth. Some \\nfirms follow detailed rules about which experiences are required; an \\nexecutive may need to work in at least two territories, for example, or \\ntwo lines of business. Others are more informal but still observe the \\nprinciple. \\nExecutives consistently report that their hardest experiences, the \\nstretches that most challenged them, were the most helpful. A. G. Lafley, \\nCEO of Procter & Gamble, was in charge of the company\\'s Asian opera-\\ntions during a major Japanese earthquake and the Asian economic col-\\nlapse. He says that\\'s when he discovered that \"you learn ten times more \\nin a crisis than during normal times.\" \\nHis crisis experiences happened by chance, but while crises can\\'t be \\n129  Talent Is Overrated \\nengineered, crisis experiences can be. A crisis was in progress at GE in \\n1988, when compressors in millions of GE refrigerators were found to \\nbe faulty and had to be replaced. CEO Jack Welch and human resources \\nchief Bill Conaty decided to put Jeff Immelt in charge of the recall, \\nthough he had zero experience with appliances or with recalls. \"It was \\na hurricane,\" Immelt says. \"But Welch and Conaty knew exactly what \\nthey were doing. And there\\'s no question I wouldn\\'t be CEO today if I \\nhadn\\'t had that job.\" \\nFind ways to develop leaders within their jobs. \\nWe\\'ve seen the value of domain expertise in any field. In business, that \\nvalue seems to be increasing. Many top-performing organizations re-\\nport new tension between their need to develop people by moving them \\nthrough different jobs and the need to develop their expertise in certain \\ndomains by leaving them in jobs. This may result from the heightened \\ncompetitiveness of a global economy; a division has a tough time com-\\npeting when the boss moves on every eighteen to twenty-four months, \\na typical pattern in many companies. So the challenge is to give people \\nthe growth benefits of new stretch assignments without moving them \\ninto new jobs so often. \\nEli Lilly is one of many companies trying harder to do that. One \\ntechnique: short-term work assignments. Managers don\\'t leave their \\njobs, but they take on an additional assignment outside their field of \\nexpertise or interest. That increases the burden on the employee, who \\nis doing not just different work but additional work. Managers seem \\nnot to mind because they realize they\\'ve been identified for extra de-\\nvelopment. The company says the approach has been a big hit. Nokia \\nis trying the same thing and reports a similar response. \\nEncourage their leaders to be active in their communities. \\nThe advantages to the company are many. Most companies have enun- \\nciated values that include respect for the individual, good citizenship, \\n130  Applying the Principles in Our Organizations \\nand integrity. When company leaders also become leaders of charities, \\nschools, and other nonprofits, they show their commitment to those \\nvalues, encouraging and inspiring employees. \\nOther benefits are more pragmatic. Community leadership roles are \\nopportunities for employees to practice skills that will be valuable at \\nwork. For example, most employees will never serve on the company\\'s \\nboard of directors or on any major corporate board. But many of them \\ncan serve on a local nonprofit\\'s board, and the experience is an excel-\\nlent opportunity to develop strategic thinking, financial analysis, and \\nmany other skills. At General Mills, an explicit part of many employees\\' \\ndevelopment plans as set by their bosses is to serve on a nonprofit \\nboard. \\nUnderstand the critical roles of teachers and of feedback. \\nWe\\'ve seen that great performance is built through activities that are \\ndesigned specifically to improve particular skills, and that in many \\nrealms teachers and coaches are especially helpful in designing those \\nactivities. At most organizations, nobody is in the role of teacher or \\ncoach. Employees aren\\'t told which skills will be most helpful to them \\nand certainly aren\\'t told how best to develop them. But most top-\\nperforming organizations have explicit coaching and mentoring pro-\\ngrams. At these enterprises, careful job assignments and other large-scale \\nprograms determine the general direction of an employee\\'s develop-\\nment; mentors provide detailed advice on which subskill§ need atten-\\ntion right now. Many of the CEOs of these companies, when asked how \\nthey reached the top, tell similar stories about the importance of a few \\nkey mentors who consistently guided and helped them. Jeff Fettig, CEO \\nof Whirlpool, is typical: \"I am here today in part due to a handful of \\npeople who, before it was in vogue, provided coaching and mentoring \\nto me early in my career. That helped me to develop.\" \\nThe other side of this coin is feedback. We\\'ve examined at length \\nthe importance of frequent, rapid, accurate feedback for improving \\n131  Talent Is Overrated \\nperformance. Most organizations are terrible at providing honest feed-\\nback. The annual evaluation exercise is often short, artificial, and mealy-\\nmouthed. Employees have no idea how well they performed and thus \\nno prospect of getting better. \\nYet nothing stands in the way of frequent, candid feedback except \\nhabit and corporate culture. Of course cultures can be formidable, but \\nthey can be changed. Any enterprise that wants a culture of true candor \\ncan have it, and there\\'s no excuse for not having it. The best-performing \\norganizations have exactly this kind of culture. For example, Immelt of \\nGE says that the people who report to him \"get coaching from me every \\ntime I see them.\" \\nMany of these companies could do even more to establish a culture \\nof candor. A powerful tool with great potential for most organizations \\nis the U.S. Army\\'s after-action review. Colonel Thomas Kolditz, who \\nruns the leadership development program at the U.S. Military Academy \\nat West Point, says that for the past twenty-five years \"it has literally \\ntransformed the Army.\" The concept is simple. After any significant ac-\\ntion, in training or in combat, soldiers and officers meet to discuss what \\nhappened. They take off their helmets—a symbolic action indicating \\nthat \"there\\'s no rank in the room,\" as Kolditz says. \"Comments are blunt. \\nIf the boss made a bad decision, often it\\'s a subordinate who points that \\nout.\" The session isn\\'t about blaming; instead, it\\'s \"a professional dis-\\ncussion,\" as an army training circular puts it. Part of its strength is that \\nit yields very complete feedback. \"The genius of it is that the junior \\npeople always know what\\'s going on,\" says Kolditz. \"If you put them in \\na position to speak openly, they will.\" \\nThe army has found another benefit of the after-action review: that \\nwhen people really understand what happened, they\\'re eager to try to \\ndo it better. This reinforces the principles of great performance. As the \\narmy training circular says, when an after-action review is done right, \\n\"not only will everyone understand what did and did not occur and \\n132  Applying the Principles in Our Organizations \\nwhy, but most importantly will have a strong desire to seek the oppor-\\ntunity to practice the task again.\" \\nThe after-action review \"is a very powerful process,\" Kolditz says. \\nIts potential value to companies and other organizations is obvious. \\nA number of firms have tried using it, usually with mixed results, and \\nthe problems are cultural. But cultures can be changed over time, and \\nthe best organizations will do the work necessary to change them in \\norder to get the benefits of truly deep and broad feedback. \\nIdentify promising performers early. \\nWe\\'ve seen hints already, and will see in detail later, that an early start \\nat development creates huge advantages. John Rice, the GE vice chair-\\nman whose career took off after Welch gave him a battlefield promo-\\ntion, says, \"Leadership capability can be evaluated on day one of \\nemployment.\" That\\'s because day one isn\\'t really day one for many em-\\nployees, who have interned at GE for at least one previous summer, en-\\nabling the company to observe their performance. A telling indicator \\nis how interns get others to work with them when they have absolutely \\nno authority. Another signal that GE looks at, separate from internships, \\nis whether someone played a team sport in college and what his or her \\nrole was. \\nWorking on people\\'s development early is a big change at most com-\\npanies, where development programs were long reserved for an elite \\ngroup several years into their careers. Many of the best-performing \\ncompanies are trying to move past that. They believe that developing \\nfuture leaders earlier than other companies creates a competitive ad-\\nvantage that lasts for decades, as their pipelines of high achievers be-\\ncome bigger, better, and more reliable. \\n133  Talent Is Overrated \\nUnderstand that people development works best through inspiration, \\nnot authority. \\nDeliberate practice activities are so demanding that no one can sustain \\nthem for long without strong motivation. How can an enterprise con-\\ntribute to that motivation? The traditional answer was that it made \\npeople do what it wanted by firing, demoting, or otherwise punishing \\nthose who didn\\'t. That never worked very well, and it works even worse \\nin today\\'s information-based economy, where most employees aren\\'t \\nturning wrenches but instead are using knowledge and relationships \\nwith results that may not be easily observed day-to-day. Try making \\nthem do what you say, or even telling them exactly what to do. A. G. \\nLafley of Procter & Gamble says, \"The command and control model of \\nleadership just won\\'t work 99 percent of the time.\" \\nThat is why a favorite word at many of today\\'s best-performing com-\\npanies is inspire. P&G runs a development program called Inspirational \\nLeadership, which focuses explicitly on teaching leaders how to inspire \\ncolleagues. At American Express, everyone at or above the vice-\\npresident level attends a program called Leadership Inspiring Employee \\nEngagement. These companies realize that they motivate best through \\na sense of mission. For some top performers, such as Medtronic or Eli \\nLilly, the mission is rooted deep in their history of saving lives or treat-\\ning illnesses. For others, identifying or even creating a sense of mission \\nrequires a journey deep into the corporate soul. That trip is not for the \\nfaint-hearted. But it is mandatory for any organization that wants to \\nmotivate employees sufficiently to become world-class performers. \\nInvest significant time, money, and energy in developing people. \\nYou don\\'t develop people on the cheap, and you don\\'t just bolt a devel-\\nopment program onto existing HR procedures. The CEOs of top-\\nperforming companies agree that people development is at the center \\nof their jobs. Indeed, the biggest investment involved may be the time \\n134  Applying the Principles in Our Organizations \\nof the CEO and other executives. At McDonald\\'s, for example, CEO Jim \\nSkinner personally reviews the development of the company\\'s top two \\nhundred managers. At GE, Immelt reviews the top six hundred. Bill \\nHawkins, CEO of Medtronic, says he spends 5 0 percent of his time on \\npeople issues, and many other top CEOs report similar percentages—\\nmaking this the largest time commitment they have. Lots of companies \\nclaim they\\'re interested in developing leaders, but the University of \\nMichigan\\'s Noel Tichy, a top authority on the subject, says testing their \\ncommitment is easy: \"Just show me the CEO\\'s calendar.\" \\nThe CEO\\'s time is only the beginning. Many of these chiefs note the \\n\"cascading\" effect of what they do: As their direct reports see what the \\nboss is focusing on, they also become devoted to developing people, as \\ndo their subordinates, and so on. Not that these companies rely solely \\non the power of example. Virtually all of them evaluate executives \\npartly on how well they\\'re developing people, including themselves. In \\nAmerican Express\\'s highly rigorous system, for example, 25 percent of \\nan executive\\'s variable pay depends on people development. \\nFurther expenses can be big, but no CEO seems to doubt their value. \\nGE\\'s Crotonville, a beautiful fifty-two-acre campus just north of New \\nYork City, obviously costs a bundle, and running thousands of manag-\\ners through it every year costs even more. But \"we fund it through good \\ntimes and bad,\" says Immelt. \"I learned that from Jack [Welch], and I \\nstill do it.\" Whirlpool decided a few years ago to upgrade its off-the-shelf \\ndevelopment curriculum by developing its own. The program is now \\nbigger than ever, and worth every cent. CEO Jeff Fettig says, \"This is the \\nsingle best investment we make in our company.\" \\nMake leadership development part of the culture. \\nThough executives at the best companies talk about their leadership \\ndevelopment programs, they generally realize the term isn\\'t quite right. \\nDeveloping leaders isn\\'t a program, it\\'s a way of living. For example, \\nhonest feedback has to be culturally okay; at many companies it \\n135  Talent Is Overrated \\nisn\\'t. Devoting significant time to mentoring has to be accepted. Work-\\ning for nonprofits has to be encouraged, not just tolerated. Such cultural \\nnorms can\\'t be dictated on short notice; they have to grow over \\ntime. That\\'s a major reason why GE is so widely regarded as the best at \\npeople development. Charles Coffin (CEO from 1892 to 1912) realized \\nthat GE\\'s real products weren\\'t lightbulbs or electric motors but busi-\\nness leaders; developing them has been the company\\'s focus ever \\nsince. \\nApplying the Principles to Teams \\nAny organization that does all these things will build tremendous com-\\npetitive advantages in its industry because its people will be developed \\nto such an unusually high level. Every enterprise wants to be filled with \\nA players, and rightly so. But that isn\\'t enough. \\nAfter all, most people in an organization don\\'t work alone. They \\nwork in teams, strictly or loosely defined. And a team\\'s performance is \\nemphatically not determined solely by the abilities of its members in-\\ndividually. Maybe you remember something called the World Baseball \\nClassic, a tournament played by a group of national teams in the spring \\nof 2006. You might suppose that no one could beat America at Ameri-\\nca\\'s game, especially since the U.S. team was filled with undeniably \\ngreat players—Roger Clemens, Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez, and Johnny \\nDamon, among others. Yet the team didn\\'t win the tournament and lost \\ngames to Mexico, South Korea, and—wait for it—Canada. Similarly, \\nthe 2004 U.S. Olympic basketball team, consisting entirely of NBA mil-\\nlionaires, finished third and lost to Lithuania, among other previously \\nunknown hoops powers. \\nTurning groups of great individuals into great teams is a discipline \\nin itself, which also operates on the principles of great performance. \\nThat\\'s why the best organizations follow one additional rule: \\n136  Applying the Principles in Our Organizations \\nDevelop teams, not just individuals. \\nFor example, Jeff Immelt recalls, \"at the GE I grew up in, most of my \\ntraining was individually based.\" But that led to problems. He\\'d attend \\na three-week program at Crotonville, but back at work \"I could use only \\n60 percent of what I\\'d learned because I needed others—my boss, my \\nIT guy—to help with the rest.\" And maybe they weren\\'t on board. Now \\nGE takes whole teams and puts them through Crotonville together, mak-\\ning real decisions about their business. Result: \"There\\'s no excuse for \\nnot doing it.\" \\nApplying the principles of great performance to team development \\nis not conceptually difficult. The same basic elements that work for \\nindividuals—well-designed practice activities, coaching, repetition, \\nfeedback, self-regulation, building knowledge, and mental models—all \\nwork for teams as well. The problems are practical. They center on \\nforces within the team that prevent it from realizing the benefits of the \\ngreat-performance approach. Organizations that are the most success-\\nful at building team performance are especially skilled at avoiding or \\naddressing potential problems that are particularly toxic to the ele-\\nments of deliberate practice, such as the following: \\nPicking the wrong team members. Every team wants great individual \\nperformers, but combining them is a skill all its own, in business or any \\nother domain. \"Some of the worst teams I\\'ve ever seen have been those \\nwhere everybody was a potential CEO,\" says David Nadler, a senior part-\\nner at the Oliver Wyman consulting firm, who has worked with execu-\\ntive teams at top global companies for more than thirty years. \"If there\\'s \\na zero-sum game called succession going on, it\\'s very difficult to have \\nan effective team.\" \\nChemistry and culture are key. Henry Ford II successfully brought \\nin the Whiz Kids, a preassembled team of U.S. Army managerial stars \\n137  Talent Is Overrated \\nthat included Tex Thornton, later founder of Litton Industries, and Rob-\\nert McNamara, later president of Ford and then U.S. secretary of de-\\nfense, when he sensed that Ford needed a revolution after World \\nWar II. The Whiz Kids had a record of working together effectively \\nfrom their army days. But fifty years later, when Ford CEO Jacques \\nNasser correctly decided that the company needed another revolution, \\nhe stuck with the old-guard team already in place. Like most old \\nguards, they weren\\'t ready for a real revolution, and when push came \\nto shove, Nasser got ejected. More seriously for Ford, the revolution \\ndidn\\'t happen. \\nFor a notably successful method of choosing team members, look \\nat Worthington Industries, the Ohio-based steel processor. When \\nan employee is hired to join a plant-floor team, he works for a \\nninety-day probationary period, after which the team determines \\nhis fate by vote. It works because much of the team\\'s pay is at \\nrisk, based on performance, so team members are clear-eyed and \\nunsparing in evaluating a new candidate\\'s contribution. CEO John \\nMcConnell could be talking about teams at any level when he says, \\n\"Give us people who are dedicated to making the team work, as op-\\nposed to a bunch of talented people with big egos, and we\\'ll win every \\ntime.\" \\nThe most inspiring U.S. Olympic team ever, the 198o hockey team \\nthat beat the Soviets at Lake Placid, was built explicitly on similar prin-\\nciples. Professional players weren\\'t eligible back then. More fundamen-\\ntally, coach Herb Brooks wanted to build a team on personal chemistry \\ncombined with extremely intensive practice. In the movie version of \\nthe story, called Miracle, Brooks\\'s assistant looks at the coach\\'s roster \\nand objects that he has left out many of the country\\'s greatest college \\nplayers. To which Brooks responds with the essential mix-is-critical \\nphilosophy: \"I\\'m not lookin\\' for the best players, Craig. I\\'m lookin\\' for \\nthe right players.\" \\n138  Applying the Principles in Our Organizations \\nLow trust. Read the extensive literature on team effectiveness, or talk \\nto people on teams in sports, business, or elsewhere, and it always \\ncomes down to this: Trust is the most fundamental element of a win-\\nning team. If people think their teammates are lying, withholding in-\\nformation, or plotting to knife them, nothing valuable will get done. \\nSimilarly, team members may not trust one another\\'s competence. Such \\nteams don\\'t create synergy. They create its opposite, dysergy—two plus \\ntwo equals three, with luck. \\nSo-called dream teams may be in trouble right from the start because \\nteam members often have particular reasons to be distrustful. In sports \\nsettings, all-star teams are brought together only briefly from teams \\nthat spend the rest of the year trying to beat one another. Even if team \\nmembers can set aside that antagonistic mind-set, they rarely have time \\nto develop confidence in one another\\'s behavior and abilities. It\\'s simi-\\nlar in business: Even if team members aren\\'t battling for the next pro-\\nmotion, someone is always getting moved or stolen away. \"A major \\nproblem is that people are transient,\" says consultant Ram Charan. Es-\\npecially on an all-star team, \"there\\'s all the headhunting, and there\\'s a \\nconstant tug to have people pulled out of the team. Instability is a major \\nissue.\" That\\'s a big problem because trust by its nature is built slowly. \\nMany companies try to speed up the trust-building process. In the \\neighties there was a virtual epidemic of people falling backward off ta-\\nbles into the arms of coworkers as a way of learning trust. Maybe it \\neven helped. Today consultants have developed many additional exer-\\ncises that involve people sharing personal stories or revealing their \\npersonality type, based on the valid insight that reciprocal vulnerability \\nis the beginning of trust. But the process can be rushed only so much. \\nIn fact, trust is so fragile and so laboriously created that it may never \\nextend very far in a top-level team. \"Building a really high-performing \\nexecutive team at the highest level is a mirage,\" says a famous manage-\\nment consultant who doesn\\'t want his name used because this particular \\n139  Talent Is Overrated \\nmessage is such a downer. \"When such teams do exist, they\\'ll consist \\nmostly of two people, maybe three.\" It\\'s just too hard to build trust more \\nextensively at the top level, where everyone is supposedly a star. \\nAnd sure enough, the legendary top executive teams are almost al-\\nways pairs. Think of Roberto Goizueta and Donald Keough at Coca-Cola \\nin the eighties and nineties, or Tom Murphy and Dan Burke at Capital \\nCities/ABC from the sixties to the nineties, or Reuben Mark and Bill \\nShanahan at Colgate-Palmolive for two decades until 2005, or Warren \\nBuffett and Charlie Munger at Berkshire Hathaway from the sixties to \\ntoday. No one would have called those pairs dream teams back when \\nthey got together; at the time, most people had never heard of them. \\nThey all developed deep trust over many years and produced outstand-\\ning results. \\nMaybe you noticed something else about those teams: Each consists \\nof a boss who became famous and a much less famous number 2 who \\ndevoted his career to the success of the enterprise. Such devotion is rare \\nand points to another pathology that frequently sinks teams. . . . \\nCompeting agendas. You don\\'t often find examples of the best and worst \\nexecutive teams involving the same person, but consider the case of \\nMichael Eisner. For the first ten years of his reign at Disney, he and COO \\nFrank Wells formed one of the great teams, saving a storied company \\nand making shareholders rich. They were a classic top pair, with a clear \\nnumber i and number 2, neither one famous outside the industry when \\nthey took the jobs. This productive partnership ended suddenly and \\nterribly when Wells died in a 1994 helicopter crash. \\nEisner then formed one of the most famously disastrous teams in \\nrecent history, bringing in iiberagent Michael Ovitz as president. He \\nlasted only fourteen months. In the extensive postmortems, the over-\\nriding theme is conflicting business and personal agendas. Ovitz wanted \\nto buy a major stake in Yahoo!, expand Disney\\'s book and record busi-\\nnesses, and buy an NFL franchise, among other big ideas that Eisner \\n140  Applying the Principles in Our Organizations \\ndismissed as off-strategy. Ovitz also seemingly had notions of his own \\nfuture—he spent $2 million remodeling his office—that did not sit well \\nwith Eisner. Bottom line: team failure. \\nIt\\'s a common problem. Just as great individual performers possess \\nhighly developed mental models of their domains, the best teams are \\ncomposed of members who share a mental model—of the domain, and \\nof how the team will be effective. Eisner and Ovitz held strongly con-\\nflicting models of Disney\\'s domain and of their own team. More broadly, \\nas noted, when everyone wants to be a CEO and has good reason to \\nthink it\\'s possible, the conflicts can become overwhelming. And while \\nit\\'s easy to condemn the political hardball and hotdogging that result, \\ndon\\'t be too quick to do so. After all, suppose you\\'re toiling away be-\\nneath the world\\'s radar and your boss gets fired—what happens to your \\ncareer? Some companies even like to spotlight rising stars because it\\'s \\ngood for the business; as these managers advance, employees want to \\nfollow them. \\nThe challenge is to keep the inevitable personal agendas from be-\\ncoming destructive. That\\'s part of the leader\\'s job. For example, Ameri-\\ntech in the nineties had an all-star team of top executives that included \\nRichard Notebaert, future CEO of Ameritech, Tellabs, and Qwest; and \\nRichard Brown, future CEO of Cable & Wireless and EDS. Michigan \\nbusiness school professor Noel Tichy, who was advising the company \\non leadership development at the time, recalls that CEO Bill Weiss told \\nthe team bluntly every week that if he caught anybody trying to under-\\nmine the others, the guilty party would be fired. \\nJack Welch used a different approach to managing potential succes-\\nsor conflicts at GE. He recalled his own miserable experience as one \\nof the CEO finalists twenty years earlier, when the company promoted \\nhim and the other main contenders to jobs at headquarters, which \\npolitics soon turned into a steaming swamp. Two decades later, Welch \\nkept his own top candidates in operating jobs hundreds of miles \\napart. \\n141  Talent Is Overrated \\nEven when ego-driven stars aren\\'t fighting for the same job, a team \\ncan still be torn apart by another curse. \\nUnresolved conflicts. Colonel Stas Preczewski, coach of the army crew \\nteam at West Point a few years ago, faced a baffling problem. Through \\nextensive testing he had determined the strengths and abilities of every \\nrower on his team. He had measured each man\\'s power on ergometers \\nand had composed crews in every possible combination in order to \\ncalculate each member\\'s contribution. He was able to rank his rowers \\nobjectively and precisely from best to worst. He then put the eight \\nbest in his varsity boat and the eight others, the weakest, in the junior \\nvarsity boat. The problem: The JV boat beat the varsity boat two-thirds \\nof the time. \\nThe situation is explained in a famous Harvard Business School case, \\nwhich also notes that the varsity boat was full of resentment over who \\nwas contributing most, while the JV rowers, feeling they had nothing \\nto lose, supported one another happily. But the case doesn\\'t tell how \\nCoach Preczewski solved his problem. \\nOne day he lined up the varsity crew in four pairs. He told them they \\nwere to wrestle for ninety seconds. Only rule: no punching. \"It was like \\nthe WWF,\" he recalls. When he stopped them, he noticed that no one \\nwas winning. Each man was discovering that his opponent was just as \\nstrong and determined as he was. Preczewski then had them change \\nopponents and wrestle again. By the third round they were choosing \\ntheir own opponents—\"One guy would point at another and say, \\'Your \\nPreczewski says. On the fourth or fifth round, one of the rowers started \\nlaughing, and they all piled into a general brawl. Eventually someone \\nsaid, \"Coach, can we go row now?\" From then on the varsity boat flew, \\nand made it to the semifinals in the national tournament. \\nYou probably can\\'t order members of an executive team to wrestle, \\ntempting though it may be. But there are other ways to discharge ten-\\nsions that are crippling a group. These conflicts are the flip side of com- \\n142  Applying the Principles in Our Organizations \\npeting agendas; instead of being focused on the future, they typically \\nlinger from the past. Bringing them out into the open and then resolv-\\ning them is one of the team leader\\'s most important jobs. Doing it is \\nan important element of dealing with a more general threat to team \\nperformance. . \\nUnwillingness to face the real issues. The usual metaphor is the elephant \\nin the room. Former Eli Lilly CEO Randall Tobias called it the moose \\non the table. George Kohlrieser, a professor at the International Insti-\\ntute for Management Development in Switzerland, has developed \\nthe metaphor particularly well: \"Put the fish on the table,\" he says. \\nIt\\'s smelly, and cleaning it is messy work, but you get a good meal in \\nthe end. \\nMost people don\\'t want to be the one who puts the fish on the table, \\nespecially on a team where it might not be culturally okay. \"There\\'s a \\nveneer of politeness,\" says David Nadler, \"or unspoken reciprocity—we \\nwon\\'t raise our differences in front of the boss.\" Consultant Ram Charan \\ndescribes a $12 billion division of ABB that was headed for bankruptcy. \\n\"One reason,\" he says, \"was its culture of polite restraint. People didn\\'t \\nexpress their honest feelings\" about the most important issues. The \\nunit\\'s leader turned it around by insisting that team members say what \\nwas really on their minds—though the first time, he had to endure sixty \\nseconds of tense, angry silence after calling on an executive to explain \\nwhy he was so clearly upset. \\nJack Welch was one of the great champions of putting the fish on \\nthe table—confronting reality, as he says. Often overlooked were his \\nefforts to make doing so easier for the top team. GE\\'s dream team was \\nand is the Corporate Executive Council, which used to meet at head-\\nquarters in a formal atmosphere with rehearsed presentations and little \\nreal discussion. Welch moved the meetings off-site, forbade prepared \\npresentations, jackets, and ties, and lengthened the coffee breaks to en-\\ncourage informal discussion, among other changes. At GE they call this \\n143  Talent Is Overrated \\nsocial architecture. Business scholars believe it was a critical element \\nin the success of Welch\\'s revolution. \\nApplying the principles of great performance in an organization is no \\neasier than doing anything else in an organization. It\\'s hard. But in an \\nincreasingly competitive global economy, enterprises that want to sur-\\nvive and thrive will face little choice. If we suppose that every organi-\\nzation will sooner or later be trying to apply these principles, then \\nit\\'s important to remember that starting early confers a significant \\nadvantage. The effects of deliberate practice activities are cumulative. \\nThe more of a head start your organization gets in developing people \\nindividually and as teams, the more difficult it will be for competitors \\never to catch you. \\n144  Chapter Nine \\nPerforming Great at Innovation \\nHow the principles we\\'ve learned \\ntake us past the myths of creativity \\nIt isn\\'t true that everything can be commoditized. It just seems like \\nit is. \\nOne of the miracles of our networked world is that buyers know so \\nmuch more about what they\\'re buying, which is a major problem for \\nthe surprisingly numerous sellers who used to depend on customer ig-\\nnorance. Most people still don\\'t buy cars online, but most car buyers \\ndo shop online before buying; you see them walking into a dealership \\nwith a dealer\\'s invoice, which they found online and printed out. That \\nchanges the balance of power. Prescription drugs have cost less in Can-\\nada for eons, but it didn\\'t matter to the pharmaceutical industry before \\nthe Internet; now it does. Families with kids in college had long been \\nfloored by the exorbitant cost of textbooks in the college bookstore, but \\nwhat choice did they have? Now they know they can often order the \\nvery same books from the United Kingdom for much less. \\nIn the digital age, any products that can be compared will be com-\\npared, and any directly comparable products will be commoditized. \\nMost brutally, this phenomenon takes the form of the reverse auction. \\nAn automaker, for example, needs a million injection-molded plastic \\nparts. It designates eight suppliers as worthy to compete for the busi-\\nness, and tells them the specs, where and when the products will be \\nneeded, and the terms on which the winning supplier will be paid. Then \\nit tells them all to get online Tuesday at eight AM and gives them an \\n145  Talent Is Overrated \\nhour to beat the living daylights out of one another on price. When the \\nbell rings at the end of the hour, the low bidder gets the business. \\nIt\\'s tempting to think that only a few low-value products could be \\nbought this way, but in fact purchasers are finding ways to use this pro-\\ncedure for buying—that is, for commoditizing—all kinds of things, in-\\ncluding high-value services. Tyco International (postscandal) used a \\nreverse auction to hire a law firm to handle its product liability cases. \\nA Kansas City-based firm called Shook, Hardy & Bacon won the busi-\\nness with an eighteen-month fixed-fee bid. \\nIf you\\'re wondering why innovation is one of the hottest topics in \\nbusiness—why leading magazines are full of articles about it, confer-\\nence organizers are putting on $2,700-a-ticket conferences on it, and \\ntop-tier management consulting firms are building practices around \\nit—this is a big part of the answer. In a world of forces that push toward \\nthe commoditization of everything, creating something new and dif-\\nferent is the only way to survive. A product unlike any other can\\'t be \\ncommoditized. A service that reaches deep into the psyche of the buyer \\ncan never be purchased solely on price. Creating such products and \\nservices was always valuable; now it\\'s essential. \\nYet fighting commoditization won\\'t do much good if you don\\'t keep \\nit up. You can never stop because product life expectancies are getting \\ndrastically shorter. In the good old days, Wrigley produced the same \\nthree flavors of gum (Spearmint, Doublemint, and Juicy Fruit) for fifty-\\nnine years and succeeded so grandly that William Wrigley built one of \\nChicago\\'s great office buildings and bought Catalina Island, among \\nother things. By contrast, consider the twenty-first-century saga of Wrig-\\nley\\'s Chicago neighbor, Motorola—heroic and innovative pioneer of \\nthe cell phone at first, then scorned failure when it didn\\'t jump fast \\nenough to digital phones, then reborn champion when it created the \\nsleek RAZR, then goat once again when it couldn\\'t produce a successor, \\nand finally a casualty of competition with its decision to unload its cell \\n146  Performing Great at Innovation \\nphone business completely. Motorola achieved lots of great cell phone \\ninnovations—just not enough of them. \\nAs products and services live shorter lives, so do the business models \\nof the companies that sell them. Time was when you could turn the \\ncrank on a good business model for thirty or forty years, and sometimes \\nmuch longer; the regulated-utility model of AT&T and electricity com-\\npanies worked for close to a hundred years. But now we hear the star-\\ntling sound of CEOs admitting publicly that their business models don\\'t \\nwork anymore. Paul Allaire said it out loud when he was CEO of Xerox; \\nMichael Armstrong said it at AT&T; Bill Ford said it at Ford. Now com-\\npanies with the most vaunted and successful business models of all \\ntime are being forced to change them. Southwest Airlines built itself \\ninto America\\'s most valuable airline with a low-fare model that gave \\nno special perks to business travelers; then results began to sag, and \\nnow it\\'s offering special deals to exactly those customers. Dell became \\nthe world\\'s largest PC maker with a model that sold directly, and only \\ndirectly, to end users; then Hewlett-Packard surged ahead, and now Dell \\nsells through Best Buy and other retailers. Adrian Slywotzky, an author \\nand consultant who has worked with America\\'s biggest companies for \\nthirty years, has said that many companies now have to create innova-\\ntive new business models every three or four years—\"eight to ten years \\nis heaven today.\" \\nCreativity and innovation may even be the key to the future eco-\\nnomic prosperity of America and other developed countries, at least \\naccording to one line of thinking. The theory, though somewhat radi-\\ncal, resonates with various trends. It\\'s radical because for three hundred \\nyears the source of economic dominance has clearly been leadership in \\nscience and technology; the countries or regions that were most ad-\\nvanced technologically have also been the most prosperous. But now a \\nnumber of analysts, including Daniel H. Pink, author of A Whole New \\nMind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future, and Virginia Postrel, \\n147  Talent Is Overrated \\nauthor of The Substance of Style: How the Rise of Aesthetic Value Is \\nRemaking Commerce, Culture, and Consciousness, argue that this era \\nmay be ending. Technology will become commoditized by China and \\nIndia, they say, being dispersed and adopted almost instantly after it\\'s \\ncreated. Economic value will arise instead from the powers of the right \\nbrain—creativity, imagination, empathy, aesthetics. \\nExhibit A in their evidence is the Apple iPod. Apple didn\\'t invent \\nthe MP3 music player; several models had been around for a few years \\nbefore anyone had heard of the iPod, but they had never gone any-\\nwhere. Apple took an existing product and gave it an elegant design, \\ncreated a simple, intuitive user interface, then added the business in-\\nnovation of the iTunes Music Store, and somehow imbued the whole \\npackage with coolness. The result is 75 percent market share in music \\nplayers and online music sales, a reordering of the music industry, and \\na multibillion-dollar boost to Apple\\'s market value. The key wasn\\'t tech-\\nnology. It was creativity, design, and a deep empathy with the \\ncustomer. \\nIn a different industry, how does Target thrive as a discount retailer \\nagainst the massive power of Wal-Mart, a company more than five times \\nits size that commands by far the world\\'s most advanced retail com-\\nputer systems? In part it does so by arranging for some of the world\\'s \\ntop designers, such as Michael Graves and Isabelle de Borchgrave, to \\ndesign some of the home\\'s most pedestrian products, such as teakettles \\nand breadbaskets, and then selling them in massive volume at discount \\nprices. Following that strategy Target can never be commoditized. \\nThe phenomenon is sufficiently widespread that the MFA degree—\\nmaster of fine arts—is gaining ground on the MBA as the preferred \\ngraduate degree for young people who want to make their mark in busi-\\nness. New York University has even begun offering a joint MBA/MFA \\ndegree. \\nCreativity and innovation have always been important; what\\'s new \\nis that they\\'re becoming economically more valuable by the day. The \\n148  Performing Great at Innovation \\nissue, then, is how individuals and organizations can best respond. To \\nhelp them, all those consultants, conferences, books, and magazines \\nhave coalesced into a vast innovation industry that offers virtually in-\\nfinite advice and guidance. Our task is not to inspect it all—impossible \\nand fruitless—but rather to see if the principles of great performance \\nprovide any deep insight into the nature of creativity and innovation \\nthat would be useful to anyone trying to grow on these dimensions. \\nThey do, and these insights are especially valuable because, as with \\ngreat performance generally, they run counter to many people\\'s deeply \\nheld beliefs. \\nWhat We Think We Know \\nTwo views in particular characterize what most of us \"know that just \\nain\\'t so\" about innovation and creativity. One is that creative ideas come \\nto us in the way a famous one came to Archimedes, in a eureka moment \\nwhen everything suddenly becomes clear. It makes sense that we be-\\nlieve this, because history as we learn it in school is filled with such \\nstories. Often they\\'re unforgettable. Archimedes running through the \\nstreets naked, having just settled into his bath and realizing he could \\nmeasure the volume of an irregular object by water displacement, is an \\nimage no schoolchild will forget. Similarly, we see Abraham Lincoln on \\nthe train to Gettysburg, writing in a burst of inspiration one of the most \\neloquent speeches in American history. Or we picture Samuel Taylor \\nColeridge, who by his own account awoke from an opium-induced sleep \\nto find \"two to three hundred lines\" of Kubla Khan standing fully formed \\nbefore him in his mind. Great creators seem time and again to be struck \\nby lightning bolts that reveal what no one else had seen or thought or \\nimagined before. \\nThe other thing we all think we know about creativity is that it can \\nbe inhibited by too much knowledge. We often say that someone is \"too \\nclose to the problem\" to see a solution. The broader principle is that if \\n149  Talent Is Overrated \\nyou know too much about a situation, a business, a field of study, then \\nyou can\\'t have the flash of insight that is available only to someone un-\\nburdened by a lifetime of immersion in the domain. Edward de Bono, \\nthe best known business consultant on creative thinking, has stated \\nthis view explicitly: \"Too much experience within a field may restrict \\ncreativity because you know so well how things should be done that \\nyou are unable to escape to come up with new ideas.\" \\nAgain, we have good reasons for believing this. We\\'ve seen it con-\\nfirmed at the organizational level countless times. Why didn\\'t Western \\nUnion invent the telephone? Why didn\\'t U.S. Steel invent the minimill? \\nWhy didn\\'t IBM invent the personal computer? Over and over, the or-\\nganizations that knew all there was to know about a technology or an \\nindustry failed to make the creative breakthroughs that would trans-\\nform the business. \\nAt the individual level the story is similar. Dean Keith Simonton, a \\nprofessor at the University of California at Davis, conducted a large-\\nscale study of more than three hundred creative high achievers born \\nbetween 1450 and 1850—Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo, Beethoven, Rem-\\nbrandt, for example. He determined the amount of formal education \\neach had received and measured each one\\'s level of eminence by the \\nspaces devoted to them in an array of reference works. He found that \\nthe relation between education and eminence, when plotted on a graph, \\nlooked like an inverted U: The most eminent creators were those who \\nhad received a moderate amount of education, equal to about the mid-\\ndle of college. Less education than that—or more—corresponded to re-\\nduced eminence for creativity. \\nOther research seems to confirm de Bono\\'s view In a famous series \\nof experiments first conducted more than sixty years ago, Abraham and \\nEdith Luchins gave their subjects the task of measuring certain amounts \\nof water using a set of different-sized jugs; for example, the jugs might \\nhold 127 units, 21 units, and 3 units, and the task might be to measure \\nout loo units precisely. The subjects learned a set routine that worked \\n150  Performing Great at Innovation \\nfor solving the first several measurement tasks they were given. When \\nthey were then given a measurement task that could be done using their \\nlearned routine or a much simpler one, they consistently failed to see \\nthe simpler one. And when they were given a task that could be done \\nonly with a simple but new routine, they failed to see it, and instead \\njust kept trying to apply their known routine. Subjects who had never \\nlearned the original routine, however, saw the simple solution easily. \\nThese concepts have permeated our views on creativity and in most \\nof us have helped form those two core beliefs: Inspiration will strike \\nwhen it\\'s good and ready, whenever that may be; and if you want a cre-\\native solution to a problem, you\\'d better find someone who knows a little \\nabout the situation but not too much. Those beliefs, though they seem \\nto be supported by evidence, will steer us wrong. They direct us away \\nfrom the creating and innovating that we\\'re capable of. The evidence \\nunderlying the principle  of deliberate practice and great performance \\nshows that in finding creative solutions to problems, knowledge—the \\nmore the better—is your friend, not your enemy. And it shows that \\ncreativity isn\\'t a lightning bolt. \\nKnow More, Innovate More \\nThe greatest innovators in a wide range of fields—business, science, \\npainting, music—all have at least one characteristic in common: They \\nspent many years in intensive preparation before making any kind of \\ncreative breakthrough. Creative achievement never came suddenly, \\neven in those cases in which the creator later claimed that it did. \\nWhether it was the transistor or the Beatles\\' Sgt. Pepper album or the \\ncell phone or Picasso\\'s Les Demoiselles d\\'Avignon, it always followed \\na long earlier period of extremely hard work, and in most cases the \\ncreative products themselves were developed over a significant pe-\\nriod. Great innovations are roses that bloom after long and careful \\ncultivation. \\n151  Talent Is Overrated \\nThe evidence is strikingly consistent. A study of seventy-six \\ncomposers from many historical periods looked at when they produced \\ntheir first notable works or masterworks, designations that were based \\non the number of recordings available. The researcher, Professor John R. \\nHayes of Carnegie Mellon University, identified more than five hundred \\nworks. As Professor Robert W. Weisberg of Temple University summa-\\nrized the findings: \"Of these works, only three were composed before \\nyear ten of the composer\\'s career, and those three works were composed \\nin years eight and nine.\" During those first ten or so years, these creators \\nweren\\'t creating much of anything that the outside world noticed. Pro-\\nfessor Hayes termed the long and absolutely typical preparatory period \\n\"ten years of silence,\" which seemed to be required before anything \\nworthwhile could be produced. \\nIn a similar study of 131 painters, he found the same pattern. The \\npreparation period was shorter—six years—but still substantial and \\nseemingly impossible to defy, even for supposed prodigies like Picasso. \\nA study of sixty-six poets found a few who produced notable works in \\nless than ten years, but none who managed it in less than five; fifty-five \\nof the sixty-six needed ten years or more. \\nThese findings remind us strongly of the ten-year rule that research-\\ners have found when they study outstanding performers in any domain. \\nOther researchers, who weren\\'t necessarily looking for evidence of this \\nrule, have found it anyway. Professor Howard Gardner of Harvard wrote \\na book-length study (Creating Minds) of seven of the greatest innova-\\ntors of the early twentieth century: Albert Einstein, T. S. Eliot, Sigmund \\nFreud, Mahatma Gandhi, Martha Graham, Pablo Picasso, and Igor \\nStravinsky. A more diverse group of subjects would be hard to imagine, \\nand Gardner did not set out to prove or disprove anything about the \\namount of work required for their achievements. But in summing up, \\nhe wrote, \"I have been struck throughout this study by the operation of \\nthe ten-year rule. . .. Should one begin at age four, like Picasso, one can \\nbe a master by the teenage years; composers like Stravinsky and danc- \\n152  Performing Great at Innovation \\ners like Graham, who did not begin their creative endeavors until later \\nadolescence, did not hit their stride until their late twenties.\" \\nNot even the Beatles could escape the requirements of deep and \\nbroad preparation before producing important innovations. Professor \\nWeisberg of Temple has studied the group\\'s career and found that they \\nspent thousands of hours /performing together—sessions that closely \\nmatched the description of deliberate practice—before the world ever \\nheard of them. In the early days they performed very few of their own \\nsongs, and those songs were undistinguished; we would never have \\nknown about them if they hadn\\'t been dug up long after the group be-\\ncame successful. The group\\'s first number I hit was \"Please Please Me\" \\n(1963), written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney after they had been \\nworking together for five and a half years. One could certainly debate \\nwhat kind of creative achievement that song represented; successful as \\nit was, it was by no means a significant innovation in popular music. \\nThat had to wait until the group\\'s so-called middle period, when they \\nproduced their albums Rubber Soul, Revolver, and Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely \\nHearts Club Band. Those albums, consisting entirely of original music, \\ntransformed the domain. By the time of Sgt. Pepper, Lennon and McCart-\\nney had been working together—extremely hard—for ten years. \\nAs for what exactly is going on during those long periods of prepa-\\nration, it looks a lot like the acquisition of domain knowledge that takes \\nplace during deliberate practice. It is certainly intensive and deep im-\\nmersion in the domain, frequently under the direction of a teacher, but \\neven when not, the innovator seems driven to learn as much as possible \\nabout the domain, to improve, to drive himself or herself beyond per-\\nsonal limits and eventually beyond the limits of the field. Gardner \\nlooked back on the stories of the seven great innovators he studied and \\nsaw so many common themes that he combined them into a story of a \\ncomposite character, whom he dubbed Exemplary Creator, or E.C. At \\nsome point in adolescence or early adult life, \"E.C. has already invested \\na decade of work in the mastery of the domain and is near the forefront; \\n153  Talent Is Overrated \\nshe has little in addition to learn from her family and from local experts, \\nand she feels a quickened impulse to test herself against the other lead-\\ning young people in the domain.\" As a result, \"E.G. ventures toward the \\ncity that is seen as a center of vital activities for her domain.\" \\nWe see some elements of deliberate practice apparent here: the large \\ninvestment in mastering the domain, the quest for more advanced in-\\nstruction, the constant pushing past the comfort zone. As that constant \\npushing continues, eventually \"E.C. discovers a problem area or realm \\nof special interest, one that promises to take the domain into uncharted \\nwaters.\" That journey can never be easy, and so here we see further par-\\nallels with great performers in other realms: \"E.G. works nearly all the \\ntime, making tremendous demands on herself and on others, constantly \\nraising the ante. In William Butler Yeats\\'s formation, she chooses per-\\nfection of the work over perfection of the life.\" We have seen these ex-\\ntremely demanding regimes before, whenever we have looked at how \\ndeliberate practice has produced great performance. \\nThose examples largely from aesthetic fields are highly relevant for \\nbusiness because many of the most important business innovations in \\ntoday\\'s world are right-brain, aesthetic creations. Many other vital busi-\\nness innovations are in the realm of science, and here the notion that \\ntoo much knowledge may interfere with innovation is even harder to \\nsupport. Consider, for example, one of the most celebrated instances of \\ncreative problem solving in all of twentieth-century science, James Wat-\\nson\\'s and Francis Crick\\'s discovery of the structure of DNA. Professor \\nWeisberg, in a detailed study, has shown that several other distin-\\nguished scientists—including one, Linus Pauling, who would go on to \\nwin a Nobel Prize for other work—were trying to solve the same prob-\\nlem at the same time, each from a different perspective. If we presume \\nthat too much familiarity with a problem is a disadvantage, then we \\nwould expect to find that Watson and Crick came at this one un-\\nburdened by the excessive data that clouded the thinking of the other \\nresearchers. But in reality, the story was just the opposite. In those pre- \\n154  Performing Great at Innovation \\nInternet days (the early 195 0s), research findings were not disseminated \\nnearly as easily as they are today, and Weisberg has shown how Watson \\nand Crick came into possession of various papers, X-ray photographs, \\nand raw data, as well as an understanding of X-ray crystallography and \\nphysics, that combined into a sum of critically important knowledge \\nthat none of the others possessed in total. Specifically, Watson and Crick \\nhad information leading them to deduce that the helix consisted of two \\nstrands (Pauling thought it was three), and that the strands were on the \\noutside, with the \"bases\"—the steps in the spiral staircase—on the in-\\nside (some researchers thought the bases projected outward from the \\nstrands). They were able to calculate the pitch of the helix—the angle \\nat which it spiraled—and how the bases connected to each other. \\nWatson and Crick were not the first to find each of these pieces of \\nthe puzzle. Other scientists realized earlier that the helix must be dou-\\nble, not single or triple, and two other teams beat Watson and Crick to \\nthe realization that the strands were on the outside of the molecule. Yet \\nWatson and Crick were the first to solve the overall problem of DNA\\'s \\nstructure because they, and they alone, had all the necessary facts. As \\nWeisberg concludes, \"one does not have to assume that Watson and \\nCrick were different (or better) thinkers than the others. They simply \\nhad available what was needed to develop the correct model of DNA, \\nand the others did not.\" \\nIf we\\'re looking for evidence that too much knowledge of the domain \\nor familiarity with its problems might be a hindrance in creative \\nachievement, we have not found it in the research. Instead, all evidence \\nseems to point in the opposite direction. The most eminent creators are \\nconsistently those who have immersed themselves utterly in their cho-\\nsen field, have devoted their lives to it, amassed tremendous knowledge \\nof it, and continually pushed themselves to the front of it. \\nAnd what about evidence for the related notion that excessive school-\\ning is correlated with lower creative achievement? The contradiction \\n155  Talent Is Overrated \\nmay amount to much less than it seems. Most obviously, years of school \\nmay not be a very good measure of domain knowledge, especially in \\ncertain realms. Someone with a Ph.D. in literature, for example, has ac-\\nquired considerable knowledge about the history and interpretation of \\nliterature, usually of a specific type; but that\\'s quite a different domain, \\nrequiring different knowledge and skills, from actually creating litera-\\nture. Indeed, in many creative fields the person who pursues an ad-\\nvanced degree has consciously chosen a path that leads to a professorship, \\nnot to a life of innovating in that domain; it makes perfect sense that \\nin these fields, those with the most years of formal schooling would be \\nless eminent as innovators. \\nIn science and technology the situation is different. Advanced edu-\\ncation is absolutely required for creative problem solving in today\\'s \\nworld; no one is going to cure cancer as a college sophomore. That\\'s \\nthe reality of today, but remember that the study correlating higher \\neducation with lower creative eminence covered the period from 145 0 \\nto 185 0. For the first half of that period, science as we know it scarcely \\nexisted; getting a high-level degree would not necessarily confer much \\nscientific knowledge in an era when the fundamental principles of the \\nscientific method were still unknown. For a research period that was \\nin large part prescientific, it shouldn\\'t be surprising that formal school-\\ning and creative eminence in science didn\\'t correlate. In short, in a wide \\nrange of fields, knowledge of the domain may bear little relation to \\nyears of schooling. \\nThe bigger picture is that the great innovators aren\\'t burdened by \\nknowledge; they\\'re nourished by it. And they acquire it through a pro-\\ncess we\\'ve seen before, involving many years of demanding deliberate \\npractice activities. \\n156  Performing Great at Innovation \\nInnovation Doesn\\'t Strike—It Grows \\nFrom here it\\'s a short step to rethinking the popular view that great \\ncreative achievements are without precedent, that they spring \"into \\nsudden existence, like Minerva from the brain of Jupiter,\" as an admir-\\ning nineteenth-century author said of James Watt\\'s steam engine. A \\ncloser look at notable innovations in business, the arts, and science (in-\\ncluding Watt\\'s steam engine) shows that they do not arise from noth-\\ningness; they are not even remotely unprecedented. Innovation doesn\\'t \\nreject the past; on the contrary, it relies heavily on the past and comes \\nmost readily to those who\\'ve mastered the domain as it exists. \\nExamples are everywhere, though none is more dramatic than Pi-\\ncasso\\'s Les Demoiselles d\\'Avignon, deemed by art historians the most \\nimportant painting of the twentieth century. Both Weisberg and Gard-\\nner, in their studies of creativity, consider it at length. It would be hard \\nto name a creative work that seems more disconnected from anything \\nthat came before, with its grotesque inhuman faces on human bodies \\nand aggressive nudity; in 1907, this was scandalous. Yet even this shock-\\ning creation was built up from many existing influences in art to which \\nPicasso had been exposed—ancient Iberian sculpture, primitive art of \\nAfrica and the South Pacific, specific figures and compositions in paint-\\nings of Cezanne and Matisse. None of that diminishes the painting\\'s \\npower; but extensive research has shown that even this landmark work \\nwas not created out of nothing, as it may well seem, but was rather a \\nbrilliant new combination and elaboration of elements that had been \\ndeveloped over time and absorbed by an artist who had worked many \\nyears at mastering his field. \\nAs in art, we also find this in science and technology, despite what \\nwe may occasionally have been taught in school. James Watt did not \\ninvent the steam engine, and what he did invent most certainly didn\\'t \\nspring into existence like Minerva from the brain of Jupiter. Many \\nsteam engines had been invented before Watt went to work in 1763, \\n157  Talent Is Overrated \\nand several engines of the type invented by Thomas Newcomen were \\nin commercial use in Britain, pumping water out of coal mines. Not \\nthat Newcomen invented the steam engine either; his device was an \\nimprovement on earlier machines, stretching back in a chain of devel-\\nopments such that no individual can be said to have invented the steam \\nengine. The Newcomen engine wasn\\'t very efficient, and Watt\\'s design \\nwas much more efficient. It was also, of course, a giant innovation that \\nthrough its role in the industrial revolution changed the course of his-\\ntory. But it was not some previously unimagined conception that burst \\nforth like a miracle. Just the opposite: It came about because Watt was \\ntrying to improve on what already existed, the Newcomen engine, and \\nhis long training as a maker of scientific instruments gave him the skills \\nand knowledge with which to do it. \\nSimilarly, Eli Whitney didn\\'t invent the cotton gin. Many machines \\nhad been developed to remove the seeds from cotton bolls, and they \\nworked, but only with long-staple cotton, which wasn\\'t economical to \\ngrow on a large scale. Whitney\\'s device, using many of the same prin-\\nciples as existing machines, worked with short-staple cotton, and that \\nmade all the difference. Again, none of this diminishes the importance \\nof the achievement; Whitney\\'s machine revolutionized the economy of \\nthe American South and changed history. But it didn\\'t appear out of \\nnowhere; it was a brilliant improvement on existing designs that was \\npossible only because Whitney understood what came before. \\nThe steam engine and cotton gin were two of the most significant \\nbusiness innovations ever, and the stories of how such innovations \\ncome about remain the same up until the present. From the telegraph \\nto the airplane to the Internet, they\\'re all adaptations and extensions \\nof what existed, made possible by great insights but entirely impossible \\nwithout a deep knowledge of, and reliance on, past achievements. Less \\nexalted innovations are no different. Inventor Jim Marggraff, who cre-\\nated the popular LeapPad electronic reading system for kids and the \\nFLY computer pen, which digitizes and stores what you write, told the \\n158  Performing Great at Innovation \\nNew York Times that \"each creation built on the work that went into \\nmaking the previous one.\" In his experience, as in the experiences of \\nother creators, innovations don\\'t get easier to develop if you distance \\nyourself from the problem. Instead, \"the aha moments grow out of \\nhours of thought and study,\" he said. Douglas K. van Duyne, an Inter-\\nnet entrepreneur who cofounded the Naviscent consulting firm, ex-\\npressed the same view to the Times: \"The idea of epiphany is a dreamer\\'s \\nparadise where people want to believe that things are easier than \\nthey are.\" \\nHow Innovators Become Great \\nIt\\'s important to realize that innovation on the scale of the FLY com-\\nputer pen, which may seem far removed from Beethoven\\'s symphonies \\nor Einstein\\'s theories, is not fundamentally different in type. Until re-\\ncently, researchers have often thought of creativity in two categories: \\nBig-C creativity, which yields famous, influential products like the in-\\ntegrated circuit or Huckleberry Finn; and little-c creativity, which pro-\\nduces everyday creations like a TV commercial or a florist\\'s arrangement \\nof flowers. But Ronald A. Beghetto of the University of Oregon and \\nJames C. Kaufman of California State University at San Bernardino \\nhave suggested that both types of innovation exist \"on the same devel-\\nopmental continuum,\" and that the continuum extends even further \\nback than little-c creativity, to what they call mini-c creativity. In this \\nframework, \"all levels of creative performance follow a trajectory that \\nstarts with novel and personally meaningful interpretations (mini-c), \\nwhich can then progress to interpersonally judged novel and mean-\\ningful contributions (little-c) and even develop into superior creative \\nperformance (Big-C).\" \\nThis perspective is highly significant because it ties together the evi-\\ndence showing that creative achievement is attained in the same way \\nas other kinds of achievement. As Beghetto and Kaufman state, \"Big-C \\n159  Talent Is Overrated \\nperformance is more likely influenced by intense deliberate practice \\nwithin a particular domain than by some special, genetic endowment \\nof a few individuals.\" As creativity scholars, they see the work of Erics-\\nson and his colleagues as providing \"compelling empirical evidence in \\nsupport of this developmental perspective, demonstrating the important \\nrole that deliberate practice plays in superior creative performance.\" \\nThat is, innovators become great in the same way that everybody \\nelse does. \\nYet we still face those research studies showing how people get stuck \\nin ruts when they deal repeatedly with the same kinds of problems. \\nHow can these be squared with the experiences of real-world innova-\\ntors that we\\'ve seen? An answer emerges when we look more closely \\nat the research. In the famous water-jar experiments, subjects in a \\nlaboratory setting were given jars and a series of five problems, each \\nof which could be solved by the same routine of filling and transfer-\\nring in a certain way. They were then given a group of different prob-\\nlems, one of which could be solved only by a simpler procedure, \\nwhich the subjects were unable to see. That result seemed to show that \\ntoo much familiarity with a problem blinds a person to innovative \\nsolutions. \\nBut if we step back and consider this situation, we see how different \\nit is from the cases of actual creative problem solvers. These research \\nsubjects had not devoted themselves to the study of this domain or \\nspent thousands of hours understanding problems of this type; as far \\nas we can tell, everything they knew about this field was what they \\nlearned from the five same-solution problems contrived by the research-\\ners and presented to them. If it then turns out that the subjects weren\\'t \\nvery good at devising solutions to other, different problems, we should \\nnot be surprised; we certainly shouldn\\'t suppose that this result tells \\nus much about the factors that help or hinder eminent innovators. \\nThese experiments have been interpreted as showing what happens \\n16o  Performing Great at Innovation \\nwhen people become too immersed in solving problems of a particular \\ntype, but they could be interpreted perhaps more plausibly, even com-\\npellingly, as showing what happens when people have not immersed \\nthemselves in their field of problem solving nearly enough. The experi-\\nments showed that subjects with no previous exposure to the problems \\nwere able to find a simple solution that the experienced subjects \\ncouldn\\'t see, but the experiments didn\\'t involve subjects who would be \\nof most interest to us—those who had devoted major time and study \\nto the problems. The research studies are interesting and justly famous, \\nbut they don\\'t contradict what we\\'ve seen in the experiences of great \\ncreators and innovators. \\nAnd what about those legends of great creative products appearing \\nsuddenly and fully formed before their creators? The answer is simple: \\nThey aren\\'t true. Coleridge may have been as good a public relations \\nman as he was a poet, or so believes one critic who says Coleridge made \\nup the dream story to help sell the poem. In any case, an earlier version \\nof the poem has been found, showing that Coleridge revised it con-\\nsiderably before publication. Even in Coleridge\\'s own version of the \\nevents, he says he faded into opium-induced slumber while reading a \\nseventeenth-century book called Pilgrimage, then woke to see his fa-\\nmous poem that begins \"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan/A stately pleasure-\\ndome decree . . .\" As the critic John Lowes discovered, Pilgrimage \\ndescribes Khan\\'s city in a passage that begins, \"In Xamdu did Cublai \\nCan build a stately Palace ...\" Coleridge, like all great creators, built on \\nan existing foundation. \\nAbraham Lincoln\\'s pen did not trace out the immortal words of the \\nGettysburg Address on the back of an envelope while he was riding to \\nthe battlefield; a number of drafts of the speech, on White House writ-\\ning paper, have been found. As for the original eureka moment, nothing \\nin Archimedes\\' extensive writings, or in the writings of any of his con-\\ntemporaries, supports or even hints at the bathtub story. Scholars have \\nconcluded that it\\'s a myth. \\n161  Talent Is Overrated \\nMaking Organizations Innovative \\nJust as the principles that produce exceptional creativity and innova-\\ntion in individuals are the same as the principles that produce great \\nperformance in general, the lessons are the same for organizations. All \\nthe steps described in the last chapter for helping organizations im-\\nprove their performance will help them become more innovative as \\nwell. In addition, organizations can observe a few other principles that \\nwill specifically improve their chances of producing valuable innova-\\ntions. The vast innovation industry has produced countless books on \\norganizational creativity; but with the principles of deliberate practice \\nand great performance in mind, a few ideas stand out. \\nThe impression that emerges most strongly from the research on \\ngreat creators is that of their enthusiastic immersion in their domain \\nand their resulting deep knowledge of it. Since organizations are not \\ninnovative—only people are innovative—it follows that the most ef-\\nfective steps an organization can take to build innovation will include \\nhelping people expand and deepen their knowledge of their field. In \\nthe previous chapter we saw some of the ways an organization can do \\nthis. An additional approach, identified by McKinsey, is creating inno-\\nvation networks within the organization—finding ways to connect peo-\\nple so that they can talk with one another about the problems they\\'re \\nworking on, the approaches they\\'re trying, and what they\\'re learning. \\nThe rationale, as explained by McKinsey\\'s Joanna Barsh, Marla M. Ca-\\npozzi, and Jonathan Davidson, is that \"Since new ideas seem to spur \\nmore new ideas, networks generate a cycle of innovation.\" We\\'ve seen \\nthat exceptional creators often build these networks on their own, a \\npattern observed by Howard Gardner, which he indicates when he notes \\nthat his Exemplary Creator moves to the big city in order to be among \\nthe leading figures of her domain. \\nOne of the main reasons why the people in organizations don\\'t pro- \\n162  Performing Great at Innovation \\nduce more innovation is that the culture isn\\'t friendly to it. New ideas \\naren\\'t really welcomed. Risk taking isn\\'t embraced. Corporate surveys \\nshow this, but we don\\'t need the surveys; we all know it from experi-\\nence. A revealing finding from McKinsey research explains why the \\nproblem doesn\\'t get fixed very often: Top management doesn\\'t think \\nit\\'s a problem. In a survey of six hundred executives, those at the top \\nthought the main reason why their company wasn\\'t more innovative \\nwas that it didn\\'t have enough of the right people. Lower-level manag-\\ners held a markedly different view—that the company had the right \\npeople, but the culture kept them from innovating as they should. Any-\\none who has spent time in organizations knows which of those two \\ngroups is more likely to be right. Changing an organizational culture \\nto be friendlier to innovation, or in any other way, is a massive, long-\\nterm project that we can\\'t explore in detail here, aside from making one \\nobservation: Culture change starts at the top. As long as those C-level \\nexecutives think the culture is fine, it will never change. That\\'s why \\nMcKinsey\\'s survey explains a great deal about why so many companies \\naren\\'t as innovative as they want to be. \\nOrganizations can take two other steps that are especially effective \\nin light of how innovation really happens: telling people what\\'s needed, \\nand giving them freedom to innovate. \\nBenjamin Zander, conductor of the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra, \\nspeaks often to business groups and typically takes them through a little \\nexercise. He finds someone in the group whose birthday is that day, or \\nthe day before or after, and brings that person forward. Then he says \\nto the group, \"It\\'s Mary\\'s birthday! Sing her her song!\" Without another \\nword of instruction, the group immediately sings \"Happy Birthday\" \\nto Mary. Then Zander says, \"Well, that was very good. But you know \\nwhat? I think you can do better. Now please sing it again, but this time—\\nbetter. Go!\" Complete silence. No one makes a sound. After several awk-\\nward seconds, Zander points out what has just happened: When \\n163  Talent Is Overrated \\neveryone understood what to do, they did it easily, together, and with-\\nout being led. But when they didn\\'t understand—when told simply to \\nsing it better—they became paralyzed. \\nIt\\'s often the same with innovation in organizations. Leaders exhort \\nthe troops to be innovative, but no one understands clearly what that \\nmeans. Unsure where to go, they go nowhere. Organizations that want \\nmore innovation would benefit from telling everyone what kind of in-\\nnovation would be most valuable. Because waiting for lightning bolts \\nwon\\'t work—people would have to devote enormous time and effort \\nto mastery of the field in which they hope to innovate—resources can \\nbe massively wasted if those people are pointed in the wrong direction. \\nThe right direction should be stated clearly: We need new ways to ex-\\ntend a product line, or new ways to expand in Latin America, or new \\nways to identify the needs of our customers, or new ways to lower our \\ncapital costs. What\\'s important is that people understand the organiza-\\ntion\\'s priorities and thus know where innovation will do the most \\ngood. \\nThe other step, giving people freedom to innovate, is a matter of \\nmotivation. The topic of why people put themselves through the rigors \\nrequired for great performance is discussed in the last chapter, but it\\'s \\nworth noting here that on creative tasks in particular, some research \\nsuggests that people perform more innovatively when they are offered \\nno extrinsic rewards; offering them a reward can actually reduce their \\ncreativity. Not all the research agrees, but the point is intuitively plau-\\nsible: People who are internally driven to create do seem more creative \\nthan those who are just doing it for the money. As we\\'ve seen, money \\nis never at the top of the list of motivators anyway, and when we\\'re ask-\\ning people to become masters of their field, we want to rely on the \\nstrongest possible inducements. That helps explain why some of the \\nmost notably innovative companies, such as 3M and Google, let em-\\nployees spend a certain amount of their time, typically 10 to 20 percent, \\non any project that they find personally compelling. Such projects \\n164  Performing Great at Innovation \\nwill not always help the company; that\\'s a risk. But the benefit is that \\nfollow-your-heart policies embody a culture of trust, which is, as noted, \\nan important contributor to creativity and almost impossibly difficult \\nfor many companies to adopt. That\\'s why companies that adopt it hold \\na competitive advantage. \\nUnderstanding where innovation comes from is particularly important \\nbecause we tend to believe deeply that this type of performance, even \\nmore than others, is a mysterious gift. It\\'s easier for most of us to be-\\nlieve that a great tennis player achieved his success through the prin-\\nciples of deliberate practice than to believe that a great inventor got \\nthere that way. But the evidence shows that the most important factor \\nin their high achievement is the same for both. Professor Raymond S. \\nNickerson of Tufts University has written that \"the importance of \\ndomain-specific knowledge as a determinant of creativity is generally \\nunderestimated, even though investigators have given it considerable \\nemphasis.\" What makes the biggest difference is the willingness to go \\nthrough the demanding process of acquiring that knowledge over time. \\nDavid N. Perkins of Harvard, surveying the many factors that have been \\nproposed as important elements of creativity, wrote, \"The clearest evi-\\ndence of all demonstrates the connection between creative thinking \\nand values broadly construed—a person\\'s commitments and aspira-\\ntions.... Much more than we usually suppose, creating is an intentional \\nendeavor.\" Wanting to achieve mastery of a field, committing to the \\nlong, hard work of achieving it, and then intending to innovate—that\\'s \\nhow it happens. \\nThe heavy burden of the evidence is that creativity is much more \\navailable to us than we tend to think. The most significant constraint, \\nas with all kinds of exceptional performance, is mostly likely to be our \\nwillingness to do the difficult work required. On that point, the study \\nof innovation in particular has raised questions that are actually sig-\\nnificant for all types of top performance: How early in life should the \\n165  Talent Is Overrated \\nwork of deliberate practice begin, and how late in life is it effective? In \\ncreative fields such as music, people may begin training when they\\'re \\nvery young and keep working until they\\'re very old. What is the larger \\nmeaning of this? Does achieving exceptional performance take longer \\nthan it used to? If so, what is the role of the supporting environment? \\nIt turns out that the power of deliberate practice extends very broadly \\nthrough life. We turn next to why that is so and what it implies. \\n166  Chapter Ten \\nGreat Performance in Youth and Age \\nThe extraordinary benefits of starting early \\nand continuing on and on \\nWhy are Nobel Prize winners receiving their awards at increasingly \\nadvanced ages? They are, and at a fairly dramatic rate. \\nThe explanation reveals a number of trends and basic realities about \\nexceptional performance. It shows why reaching the highest levels in \\nmany fields is harder than it used to be. That fact forces us to examine \\nthe effectiveness of deliberate practice throughout life, from the earli-\\nest ages to the oldest. It also leads us to consider the kinds of support \\nstructures that will be needed to help anyone reach exceptional achieve-\\nments in the future—for one of the most consistent findings in the re-\\nsearch is that nobody makes this journey alone. \\nThe advancing ages of Nobel laureates and other innovators was \\ndiscovered by Benjamin F. Jones of the Kellogg School of Management \\nat Northwestern University. He examined the winners of Nobel Prizes \\nin the sciences and economics as well as others who had made the most \\nnotable advances in science and technology over a period that was \\nroughly the twentieth century. When he determined the ages at which \\nthey had made their outstanding advances, he found a surprising \\nfact: The average age had increased by about six years during just a \\none-hundred-year period. The finding survived every test of statistical \\nsignificance. Something big was going on, but why? \\nThe most obvious explanation would be that average life spans \\nincreased greatly over the twentieth century, so this finding makes \\n167  Talent Is Overrated \\nperfect sense. Of course Nobel laureates were getting older; so was \\neverybody else. The trouble is, this explanation doesn\\'t hold up. Scien-\\ntists and economists very rarely make important contributions in their \\nlater years, so it doesn\\'t matter that they might be living to eighty rather \\nthan sixty-five. In addition, confirming this logic, Jones was able to use \\nsophisticated statistical techniques to control for the aging population, \\nand he found that its effect was zero. \\nThe real explanation was at the other end of the spectrum. These \\neminent innovators were getting older not because the oldest ones were \\npulling the average up, but because the youngest ones were pushing the \\naverage up. Einstein won the Nobel Prize in physics for work he did at \\nage twenty-six, and no one thought that was remarkable. Quite the con-\\ntrary. Paul Dirac, who also won a Nobel Prize in physics for work he did \\nat age twenty-six (in 1928), wrote a famous verse on exactly this point: \\n\"Age is, of course, a fever chill/ that every physicist must fear./ He\\'s \\nbetter dead than living still/ when once he\\'s past his thirtieth year.\" \\nYet by the century\\'s end, any physicist who died before the age of \\nthirty would probably remain unheard of. Jones found that the innova-\\ntors he studied began making active contributions to their fields at age \\ntwenty-three, on average, in 1900, but by 1999 the average age had risen \\nto thirty-one, a very large increase of eight years, and of course the ages \\nat which they made their greatest contributions were even later. The \\nreason Nobel laureates and other innovators are getting older is not \\nthat they\\'re living longer but that it\\'s taking them significantly longer \\nto make a contribution in the first place. \\nOther research shows that this trend applies not just to the most ad-\\nvanced thinkers. The age at which people receive their first patent, \\nacross a wide range of fields in business and government, has been in-\\ncreasing at a rate of six to seven years per century. Jones concluded, \\n\"Taking the facts together, we see similar trends among both the great-\\nest minds and ordinary inventors. We appear to be seeing a general \\nphenomenon.\" \\n168  Great Performance in Youth and Age \\nIt\\'s general because it\\'s happening in all heavily knowledge-based \\nfields, including those in which many people work. Knowledge is the \\nfoundation of great performance, and in fields where important ad-\\nvances are being made continually, mastering the accumulated knowl-\\nedge takes longer all the time. That\\'s easy to see in physics. When you \\nthink of all the twentieth-century giants in this field—Planck, Bohr, \\nHeisenberg, Fermi, Feynman, and many others—it\\'s clear why today\\'s \\naspiring physicist needs many more years of preparatory study than \\neven Einstein did. \\nBut the same principle holds beyond physics and the other hard sci-\\nences, extending into all knowledge-rich realms, emphatically including \\nbusiness. Economics and corporate finance have been transformed in \\nthe past hundred years. Marketing, operations research, organizational \\nbehavior—all have developed into advanced disciplines that require \\nfar more study than in the past. Even the ever-swelling U.S. tax code—\\nnow four times longer than War and Peace—demands many years of \\ndevoted study by those whose work requires that they understand it. \\nThe Nobel Prize effect is happening in all these domains and many \\nmore. \\nReinforcing that effect are generally rising standards, which are forc-\\ning more intensive preparation on anyone who hopes to excel. We saw \\nin chapter 1 how several factors are pushing standards up in virtually \\nevery domain as competition increases and methods of advancement \\nare constantly improved. And not just in the world of work: All parents \\nwith kids applying to college seem to be extremely glad that they ap-\\nplied back when they did, and not today. \\nThe Supporting Environment \\nAs the demands of excellence increase in every field, so grows the im- \\nportance of the supporting environment in which prospective achievers \\ndwell, starting at the earliest age. No one becomes extraordinary on his \\n169  Talent Is Overrated \\nor her own, and a striking feature in the lives of great performers is the \\nvaluable support they received at critical times in their development. \\nCertainly some great performers have had to fight poverty and discour-\\nagement, but that\\'s not the same as lack of support. In virtually every \\ncase, the supporting environment is critical. \\nIt exists at several levels, some of which you can\\'t do much about—\\nthough the findings on supporting environments at every level furnish \\ninsight that\\'s valuable in shaping environments that you can control. \\nDean Keith Simonton has observed that \"expertise of the highest order \\nis most likely to appear in a particular sociocultural context.\" For ex-\\nample, Kenneth Clarke, the famous English art critic and author of \\nCivilization, believed that great art was usually created amid stability; \\nyou won\\'t get many great statues or symphonies from residents of a \\ncity under siege. Simonton\\'s research found that \"exceptional creators \\nare less likely to develop during times of anarchy but are more likely \\nto develop during periods of political fragmentation, when a civiliza-\\ntion is divided into numerous independent states,\" which is a pretty \\ngood description of Renaissance Italy. Cultures encourage or discour-\\nage specific pursuits at different times. In Western cultures today you\\'ll \\nget plenty of support for medical research into a cure for cancer, but \\ntwo hundred years ago phony cancer cures were so prevalent that you \\nwould have been regarded as a dangerous charlatan. \\nIf the culture is at one end of the spectrum of supporting \\nenvironments—the widest, most immutable part—then at the other \\nend is the home, and wide research suggests that it is by far the most \\nimportant part. The circumstances in which people begin developing \\nin their eventual field of achievement can make a major difference, and \\neven in business and other domains where development often begins \\nlater than childhood, findings about effective supporting environments \\nin the home hold larger lessons that can be applied more generally. \\nThe greatest value of a supporting home environment is that it en-\\nables a person to start developing early. We\\'ve seen that in a few spe- \\n170  Great Performance in Youth and Age \\ncialized fields, such as baseball pitching and ballet, the body can be \\nadapted in critical ways only at early ages, after which the bones calcify \\nand the changes become impossible; the pitcher will never get his arm \\nback and the dancer will never turn her feet out as fully as necessary. \\nBrain adaptations seem to follow a similar pattern in at least a few \\ncases. Violinists\\' brains devote more territory to the workings of the left \\nhand—the one that plays the notes—than do other people\\'s brains, and \\nalso more space than is devoted to the workings of their own right \\nhands, with the effect much more pronounced in people who started \\ntheir music study at an early age. A separate effect involves myelin, the \\nsubstance that wraps slowly around neurons with practice, insulating \\nand strengthening key connections in the brain. Practice in childhood \\ncauses myelin to build up more than does practice in adulthood. A study \\nof professional pianists found that the more practice they did before \\nage sixteen, the more myelin they had in the critical parts of their \\nbrains. Starting early holds advantages that become less available later \\nin life. \\nYet even more important than these advantages is a different factor, \\nand that is the simple matter of time and resources. As we have seen \\nrepeatedly, becoming world-class great at anything seems to require \\nthousands of hours of focused, deliberate practice. For example, the \\ntop-ranked violinists in the Berlin study had accumulated about ten \\nthousand hours of practice by age twenty, at which point they were \\npracticing some twenty-eight hours a week and spending many addi-\\ntional hours studying, taking lessons, preparing, and organizing. \\nFor an adult facing the responsibilities of a family and a career, devot-\\ning that kind of time to purely developmental activities—activities \\nthat cost money rather than earn money—would be exceedingly \\ntough. Only in childhood and adolescence will the time typically be \\navailable. \\nThat reality creates another advantage to starting early, a competi-\\ntive one that we\\'ve considered before. In any field where people can \\n171  Talent Is Overrated \\nstart early, starting late may put one in an eternal and possibly hopeless \\nquest to catch up. For example, when those top-ranked violinists turn \\nprofessional, they don\\'t stop practicing. On the contrary, they practice \\neven more, averaging more than thirty hours a week, accumulating \\nmore than fifteen hundred hours a year. Any adult thinking of starting \\na professional career in any field in which some participants begin their \\ndevelopment as small children should first get out a calculator and face \\nthe music. \\nWhat Homes Can Teach Organizations \\nThe specific nature of the supporting environment is obviously crucial, \\nand a number of researchers have identified the most important char-\\nacteristics. In the largest and most famous examination of the topic, \\nthe legendary educational researcher Benjamin S. Bloom directed a \\nstudy of 120 young men and women who were among America\\'s top \\nperformers in widely divergent fields—piano playing, sculpting, swim-\\nming, tennis, mathematics, and neurology. After extensive interviews \\nwith the performers and their families, his team found that their home \\nenvironments shared a number of traits. \\nDespite wide variations in the parents\\' backgrounds, professions, \\nand incomes, their homes tended to be child-oriented. Kids were im-\\nportant, and the parents were willing to do a lot—almost anything—to \\nhelp them. The parents also believed in and modeled a strong work \\nethic. Work came before play, obligations had to be met, goals were to \\nbe pursued. In one of the most cited conclusions from Bloom\\'s report, \\nhe found that \"To excel, to do one\\'s best, to work hard, and to spend one\\'s \\ntime constructively were emphasized over and over again.\" In an orga-\\nnization, this would be called the culture—the norms and expectations \\nthat are simply in the air. \\nThe parents of these high achievers gave them strong guidance on \\nthe general choice of a field, but chance played a large role in the spe- \\n172  Great Performance in Youth and Age \\ncific choice. The artists tended to come from artistic parents, the ath-\\nletes from athletic parents, the mathematicians and neurologists from \\nvery learned parents, and the parents provided early encouragement \\nin those directions. But a child might end up studying the piano because \\na piano was available, or become a swimmer because the swimming \\nteam needed one more member. The children were not irresistibly \\ndrawn to specific fields, nor did their parents force them. \\nThe parents did choose teachers, which was one of their most im-\\nportant roles as their children progressed and needed to be challenged \\nat higher levels. The child\\'s initial teacher was almost always someone \\nwho happened to be convenient--a local coach, teacher, or relative. But \\ninvariably these kids progressed to a level where they needed a better \\nteacher, and these next teachers were frequently not convenient; par-\\nents had to devote lots of time and energy to finding the right teacher \\nand then driving the child to and from lessons. Ultimately these young \\nachievers moved on to some form of master-level teacher, a step that \\ndemands major sacrifices of time, money, and energy by both parents \\nand students. \\nIn an organization this progression is analogous to choosing devel-\\nopmental assignments that continually stretch an employee\\'s abilities. \\nEmployees aren\\'t children, but many of them, like children, will not \\nvoluntarily keep seeking new work experiences that stress their weak-\\nest professional muscles; the temptation to continue doing what you \\ndo comfortably is too great. Employers, like parents and coaches, have \\nto keep pushing them to develop, and the lesson for employers is that \\nthe process requires sacrifices on their part as well—in the form of \\nsuboptimal performance by a business unit when a manager is taken \\naway from it for a developmental assignment elsewhere, or periods of \\nlittle or no productivity from an employee while he or she is learning \\nnew skills. But the lesson also is that these sacrifices pay off. \\nIn addition to choosing appropriate new teachers, the parents in the \\nresearch project monitored their children\\'s practice, made sure there \\n173  Talent Is Overrated \\nwas time for it, and made sure they did it. This is worth a closer look \\nnot only because practice is centrally important to achievement but \\nalso because kids in particular seem to hate it. If the research suggests \\nfactors that contribute to kids practicing, those findings may be valu-\\nable to everyone. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi of the University of Chicago \\nand colleagues investigated why it\\'s easier for some adolescents than \\nothers to sustain concentrated, effortful study, the core of deliberate \\npractice and high achievement. The research focused on the students\\' \\nfamily environments, evaluating them on two dimensions, stimulation \\nand support. A stimulating environment was one with lots of opportu-\\nnities to learn and high academic expectations. A supportive environ-\\nment was one with well-defined rules and jobs, without much arguing \\nover who had to do what, and in which family members could rely on \\none another. The researchers classified family environments as stimu-\\nlating or not and supportive or not, creating four possible combinations. \\nAdolescents living in three of those combinations reported the typi-\\ncal low-interest, low-energy experience of studying. But in the fourth \\ncombination, the environment that was both stimulating and support-\\nive, students were much more engaged, attentive, and alert in their \\nstudying. \\nThis key finding fits exactly with observations in Bloom\\'s research. \\nThe environments he examined were also stimulating—\"parents en-\\ncouraged the curiosity of their children at an early age and answered \\ntheir questions with great care\"—and were structured and supportive, \\nwith everyone having clear roles and tasks, and parents going to some \\nlengths to support their children\\'s practice. In this light we see another \\nclue to why so few organizations produce a steady flow of top perform-\\ners. Most organizations are not intellectually stimulating, even when \\nthe field itself might seem fascinating; rather than offering opportuni-\\nties to learn and rewarding curiosity, the typical organization leaves \\ninquisitive employees to find their own ways to learn. And instead of \\nfurnishing structure and support—meaning clear roles and responsi- \\n174  Great Performance in Youth and Age \\nbilities in a positive, forward-looking, build-on-successes environment—\\nmany organizations operate in a cover-your-ass culture that is mainly \\nabout avoiding blame. Such cultures have always seemed like a miser-\\nable fact of life, but the research on supporting environments shows \\nspecifically why they\\'re poisonous. It shows additionally why any or-\\nganization that can buck the trends by providing stimulation, structure, \\nand support is not only rare but also powerful. \\nShould We Create Business Prodigies? \\nWe\\'ve seen often that early training can produce high achievers who \\nare surprisingly young, and the research has shown us how that hap-\\npens. We\\'ve grown accustomed to watching sixteen-year-old pianists, \\nchess players, and gymnasts who are astoundingly good. Yet why is it \\nthat in certain other fields, notably business, we never see sixteen-year-\\nold wonders? The glib answer is that a kid of that age can\\'t legally sign \\na check or a lease; in fact that answer embodies larger truths about \\nwhen to begin training a young person in particular domains, how to \\ndo it, and what the principles of early development mean for business \\nand related fields. \\nThe fundamental reason why there are no teenage prodigies in cer-\\ntain domains is that it\\'s impossible to accumulate enough development \\ntime by the teenage years. Sometimes the reason is simply physical size. \\nA five-year-old can practice the piano or violin—reduced-size violins \\nare made for that purpose—but cannot practice the trombone or double \\nbass because they\\'re just too big. So world-class trombonists and \\ndouble-bassists tend to be older. In other cases a decade of development \\nis not enough. This is the Nobel Prize effect: There are no teenage par-\\nticle physicists, even though a child can start learning math and science \\nat age five, because acquiring the necessary knowledge these days seems \\nto take at least twenty years. \\nIs that why we don\\'t see eighteen-year-old business wizards- \\n175  Talent Is Overrated \\nbecause the sheer volume of necessary knowledge is too great to be ac-\\nquired by that age? The explanation doesn\\'t seem completely persuasive. \\nLet\\'s leave aside those businesspeople who are actually scientists on the \\npayroll of a corporation, and focus on managers. The knowledge and \\nskills needed to be a successful manager are formidable for sure. On \\nthe other hand, as any manager who\\'s being frank will tell you, running \\na business is frequently not rocket science. Formulating a business unit \\nstrategy is a lot of work, but not work on the order of, say, proving Fer-\\nmat\\'s Last Theorem (which took 357 years). \\nThe answer may instead be that traditionally, training in business \\nskills doesn\\'t start early. Our discussion of early development will have \\ncaused any businessperson to reflect that virtually nothing like this \\nhappens in business—there isn\\'t intensive, focused development of \\nbusiness skills in young people that\\'s anything like what happens with \\nswimmers, artists, and mathematicians, for example. The question then \\narises of whether it\\'s even possible. Postponing for a moment the issue \\nof whether it\\'s desirable, would it be possible and effective to train \\nyoung people intensively in business knowledge and skills? \\nThe answer is clearly yes. Development must always begin at the \\nbeginning, so you wouldn\\'t try teaching a five-year-old about the capital \\nasset pricing model or the inner workings of the Food and Drug Ad-\\nministration. But you could start teaching basic domain knowledge—\\nthe facts of a specific business—and of course this was done routinely \\nfor centuries until fairly recently. Kids started learning the family busi-\\nness or some other business before age ten. We can appreciate the wis-\\ndom of the apprenticeship system, which immersed people in a \\nparticular field under a skilled teacher\\'s direction from a young age, in \\nkeeping with the basic principles of early development. \\nBeyond general domain knowledge, it would be possible to train \\nquite young people in more specific business skills. Basic finance con-\\ncepts would fit perfectly well in an elementary-level math curriculum; \\njust ask Ram Charan, one of the world\\'s most eminent management \\n176  Great Performance in Youth and Age \\nconsultants, who says his deep feel for corporate finance began with \\nwhat he learned in his family\\'s shoe shop in India, where he worked \\nfrom the age of eight. Larry Bossidy, former CEO of Honeywell and one \\nof the most celebrated CEOs of recent decades, will tell you something \\nsimilar about his childhood experiences in his own family\\'s shoe shop \\nin Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Fairly young children could also be edu-\\ncated in the business aspects of probability and statistics, which are \\nextraordinarily important in making good economic decisions and \\navoiding the irrational errors that people very commonly commit, as \\nthe study of behavioral finance has revealed. Corporations\\' number-one \\ncomplaint about new young employees is that they\\'re terrible at writ-\\ning and speaking; training them in those skills from a business perspec-\\ntive could begin at a very early age. From such beginning steps, it would \\nseem possible to train young people several hours a day over a period \\nof many years for high achievement in a specific business. \\nIt would be possible—but would it be good? Should we use the prin-\\nciples of great performance and early development to turn out little \\nJack Welches and Donald Trumps prepared to be corporate titans by \\nthe time they reach voting age? The evidence suggests we could do it, \\nor at least come close, yet most of us instinctively reject that idea. Why? \\nThe instinct is worth examining. \\nDeveloped countries don\\'t use the apprenticeship system anymore \\nbecause in the nineteenth century the nature of work changed. Most \\nAmericans back then got no more than an eighth-grade education, \\nwhich was all you needed to work on a farm, and that\\'s what most peo-\\nple did. But as the industrial revolution made farming more efficient—\\nthus requiring fewer people—and sparked the growth of factories, \\nwhich needed more people, eighth-grade schooling was no longer \\nenough. In the early twentieth century something called the high school \\nmovement swept America as towns nationwide decided that every stu-\\ndent should complete twelve years of schooling. At first this was job \\ntraining; the new high schools taught students basic math, English, and \\n177  Talent Is Overrated \\nscience skills, and sometimes much more specific skills as well, that \\nwould equip them for the growing industrial economy. But later, as the \\ncountry got richer, high school curricula expanded beyond job skills \\ninto all corners of the liberal arts. More students went on to college, the \\ngreat majority pursuing liberal arts majors. It became a mark of the \\ndeveloped world\\'s twentieth-century prosperity—many would say one \\nof its proudest achievements—that a full, rounded, advanced education \\ncame within reach of almost everyone. Your work and daily life might \\nnever require you to know Homer or Shakespeare or the history of Rus-\\nsia, or, for that matter, trigonometry or chemistry. But there\\'s more to \\nlife than work, and knowing these things enriches your life and makes \\nyou a more fulfilled person. \\nSeen from that perspective, the idea of adults deciding to sacrifice \\ntheir child\\'s broad education in order to put little Max or Ashley through \\nhours of daily training to become a top-notch business executive by age \\ntwenty-one seems barbarous. And maybe it is. But as we think about it, \\nlet\\'s keep a couple of points in mind. \\nFirst, our society has very little problem with kids being directed \\ntoward fields other than business at early ages. No one seems to think \\nthat Earl Woods was a bad father for directing Tiger emphatically \\ntoward golf from the age of eighteen months. On the contrary, he seems \\nto have been a wonderful father, and his son adored him. Nor do we \\nseem to mind when young achievers in other fields sacrifice a broad \\neducation in order to focus on their chosen domains. A bit of tut-tutting \\nfollowed LeBron James\\'s decision to go straight from high school to pro \\nbasketball, but now that he\\'s enormously wealthy and popular, that\\'s \\nall forgotten. The Polgar sisters learned enough about nonchess subjects \\nto pass the required exams, but they never went to school at all; none-\\ntheless, the Hungarian public hailed them as national heroes. In these \\nand other cases of high achievement at early ages, the brilliance of what \\nhas been achieved blots out any sight of what has been given up. If \\n178  Great Performance in Youth and Age \\nsimilar techniques were applied to early training in business, and simi-\\nlar results produced, would the same effect follow? \\nSecond, even if we reject the notion of purposefully turning five-\\nyear-olds into future banking executives or textile plant managers or \\nretail strategists, other societies may not hesitate. Fast-developing na-\\ntions in Asia, Africa, and Latin America will view the research on early \\ndevelopment from their own perspectives, and there\\'s no reason to as-\\nsume they\\'ll be just like ours. If governments or families in some of \\nthese countries decide to focus on turning out managers who are whiz-\\nzes at age twenty-one and will just keep getting better, we will have to \\nconfront that reality and perhaps think again about our own views. \\nDefying Age \\nOur look at how some people reach remarkable heights at early ages \\nshould not obscure an important fact about age and achievement: Even \\nwhen young people perform exceptionally, they usually develop further. \\nYo-Yo Ma was a world-famous cellist at age twenty, but he was much \\nbetter at forty. Jamie Dimon was an amazingly accomplished financial \\nservices executive at age twenty-nine, but he was much better at fifty, \\nas CEO of JPMorgan Chase. The reality of continued improvement over \\nmany years has led researchers to study how great performers develop \\nover their lifetimes. The findings illuminate how performance is—and \\nisn\\'t—affected by advancing age. \\nOne of the best established and least surprising findings in psy-\\nchology is that as we age, we slow down. Remembering things, solving \\nunfamiliar problems—these take about twice as long in our sixties as \\nthey did in our twenties. We move more slowly. Coordinating our arms \\nand legs is more difficult. We\\'ve all seen it happen, and anyone in their \\nthirties or beyond has experienced it. So we might reasonably suppose \\nthat this unavoidable trend spells doom for excellent performance. If \\n179  Talent Is Overrated \\nour minds and bodies deteriorate with the march of time, there would \\nseem to be nothing we can do to maintain top-level performance be-\\nyond a certain number of years. \\nThus it\\'s surprising to find that this isn\\'t true at all, and not just in \\na few notable cases, but generally. Somehow, excellent performers \\nmanage to continue achieving at high levels well beyond the point \\nwhere age-related declines would seem to make that impossible. \\nExample: On January 10, 2008, the New York Philharmonic made an \\nannouncement that shocked those who were intimately familiar with \\nthe orchestra as well as those who knew nothing about it. The news \\nwas that Stanley Drucker, the Philharmonic\\'s principal clarinetist, would \\nretire after the 2008-2009 season. That surprised aficionados, because \\nDrucker was such a fixture of the Philharmonic that it was hard to imag-\\nine the orchestra without him. But it surprised nonfans even more be-\\ncause it seemed impossible to believe: By the time of his retirement, \\nDrucker would have been performing with the Philharmonic for sixty-\\none years. Possessing what must be one of the working population\\'s \\nshorter résumés, he joined the orchestra at age nineteen and would be \\nretiring at eighty. \\nCases of people working for the same employer for extremely long \\ntimes are not rare, but this is different. How could anyone as old as \\nDrucker possibly perform at the level required of the lead clarinetist in \\none of the world\\'s preeminent orchestras? How could he move his fin-\\ngers fast enough? How could he remember long clarinet concertos, \\nwhich he continued to perform from memory as a soloist? \\nResearch reveals an answer that applies across fields. Studies in a \\nvery broad range of domains—management, aircraft piloting, music, \\nbridge, and others—show consistently that excellent performers suffer \\nthe same age-related declines in speed and general cognitive abilities \\nas everyone else—except in their field of expertise. For example, a study \\nof older expert pianists found that their general processing speed had \\ndeclined just as their age would predict. Among the general population \\n18o  Great Performance in Youth and Age \\nthis decline is evident in many ways. Psychologists measure how fast \\npeople can push a button in response to a question on a screen or how \\nfast they can tap their fingers or coordinate finger movements; all these \\nthings slow down with age. But while excellent pianists slowed down \\nlike everyone else in how fast they could respond to a choice on a \\nscreen, which is not a skill that makes much difference to a pianist, they \\ndidn\\'t slow down at all when it came to piano-related skills like finger \\ntapping or finger coordination. They could do those things as if they \\nhadn\\'t aged at all. It\\'s the same story in many other fields. When it \\ncomes to tasks that are part of their domain of expertise, great perform-\\ners can keep performing at a high level even after their skills outside \\ntheir domain have deteriorated. \\nIn light of what we\\'ve seen about the nature of great performance, \\nthis finding shouldn\\'t be surprising. After all, we\\'ve seen repeatedly \\nthat great performance doesn\\'t come from superior general abilities; it \\ncomes from specific skills that have been developed in a particular way \\nover a long period of time. So it makes sense that when general abili-\\nties decline with age, that decline need not affect the specific skills that \\nundergird great performance. It need not affect them—yet there must \\nbe more to the story, because of course there are plenty of great per-\\nformers whose skills do indeed decline with age. For every Stanley \\nDrucker, there are many others whose names we\\'ve forgotten, high-level \\nperformers in many fields who faded away after brief, successful ca-\\nreers. So why do some carry on, but not others? \\nThe explanation seems to be the factor that made them excellent \\nperformers in the first place, deliberate practice. Just as mere experi-\\nence, even decades of it, is not enough to make anyone a great per-\\nformer, neither is it enough to defy the effects of age, even in a person\\'s \\nfield of specialization. Several studies have shown that just continuing \\nto work at a job is not enough to stave off age-related declines. Archi-\\ntects have presumably developed strong spatial abilities, for example, \\nbut in a study of architects who were not distinguished except by \\n181  Talent Is Overrated \\ncontinued employment, those abilities declined predictably with age. \\nIt takes something more, and what it takes is effortful, focused, de-\\nsigned practice. Those expert pianists who maintained their piano skills \\nas they aged were compared with a sample of amateur pianists, some \\nof whom had forty years of experience but had long since given \\nup anything that could be called deliberate practice. The amateurs, \\nunlike the experts, suffered predictable, across-the-board age-related \\ndeclines. \\nThe reason deliberate practice works in this way is no mystery, for \\nwe\\'ve already seen the effect. In general, well-designed practice, pur-\\nsued for enough time, enables a person to circumvent the limitations \\nthat would otherwise hold back his or her performance, and circum-\\nventing limitations is the key to high performance at an advanced age. \\nIn a study of excellent chess players, the older ones chose moves just \\nas well as the younger ones, but they did it in a different way. They \\ndidn\\'t consider as many possible moves because they couldn\\'t, but they \\ncompensated through greater knowledge of positions. \\nMore generally, continued deliberate practice enables top perform-\\ners to maintain skills that would otherwise decline with age, and to de-\\nvelop other skills and strategies to compensate for declines that can no \\nlonger be avoided. That approach can work for a long time. The piano \\nvirtuoso Wilhelm Backhaus said that in his fifties he increased his prac-\\ntice of etudes, which he felt he needed in order to maintain his techni-\\ncal skills. At a later age, the pianist Arthur Rubinstein felt that he could \\nno longer play as fast as he used to, but he developed a strategy for \\ncompensating: In the passages preceding the fast ones, he would slow \\ndown more than he used to, so the following passages, even though he \\nplayed them slower than in the old days, would seem faster by contrast. \\nHe continued to perform publicly, to great acclaim, until he was \\neighty-nine. \\nJust as improved methods of practice have raised standards of per-\\nformance in virtually every field over time, they are also enabling top \\n182  Great Performance in Youth and Age \\nperformers to continue achieving at high levels for more years than \\npreviously thought possible. We see the effect dramatically in sports, \\nwhere the average age of professional players has been edging up for \\nyears. In baseball, Julio Franco played for the Atlanta Braves in the 2007 \\nseason at age forty-nine, thanks to a regimen of intense exercise and \\ncarefully designed diet that\\'s unlike anything that was used in baseball \\ndecades ago. His trainer told the New York Times, \"When I got ac-\\nquainted with him, I learned quickly that you can\\'t associate him with \\npeople of his age. His discipline is unlike anything I\\'ve ever seen.\" \\nFranco is by far the oldest player in major league baseball, and that\\'s \\nassuming you believe he was born in 1958, as his official bio states. \\nEarly bios said 1954, which would make him a fifty-three-year-old major \\nleague player. \\nOther sports have their Methuselahs. In pro football, Atlanta\\'s Morten \\nAndersen is forty-seven, and in pro basketball, Houston\\'s Dikembe \\nMutombo is forty-two; each is at or near his sport\\'s all-time-record age, \\nand as of this writing, each is still playing. The same phenomenon is \\nhappening in amateur sports—running, swimming, and others. Re-\\nsearchers are finding many examples of runners who, through harder \\nand better-designed training, maintain performance as they age at lev-\\nels never previously matched, and even some who improve, running \\nfaster at sixty than they did at fifty. A seventy-four-year-old man in 2004 \\nran a marathon in 2:54:44, which is four minutes faster than the gold \\nmedal performance in the 1896 Olympics. \\nWe can also train our mental abilities far later in life than previously \\nbelieved. For decades the conventional view in medicine was that once \\nwe reach adulthood, we can only lose neurons, not add them, and our \\nbrain\\'s ability to adapt itself to new challenges, known as brain plastic-\\nity, shuts down. More recent research shows that none of this is true. \\nOur brains are perfectly able to add new neurons well into old age when \\nconditions demand it, and brain plasticity doesn\\'t stop with age. Give \\nyour brain the right kind of training—for example, by making it try to \\n183  Talent Is Overrated \\ndo two things at once—and plasticity will increase in the regions that \\nnormally show the greatest atrophy in later years. \\nA phenomenon like the aging of professional athletes may be occur-\\nring in purely cognitive fields as well. Certainly we\\'re seeing business-\\npeople performing at the highest levels at advanced ages. Warren \\nBuffett continues to run Berkshire Hathaway brilliantly in his late sev-\\nenties. Rupert Murdoch, at about the same age, is aggressively expand-\\ning his huge media conglomerate, News Corporation. Henry Kissinger \\ncontinues his work as a consultant in his mideighties, and Sumner Red-\\nstone continues to run Viacom and CBS at the same age. This is not \\nmerely an instance of life expectancies increasing generally; what\\'s \\nsignificant is that these executives and others are able to continue work-\\ning effectively at the top echelons of business ten or twenty years past \\nwhat used to be considered normal retirement. \\nEven Benjamin Jones\\'s study of top scientific innovators may be \\nworth updating. Recall his finding that the upper limit of their ages at \\nthe time of their innovations wasn\\'t increasing; achievement fell off \\nsharply after about age forty, and the average age of the whole group \\nwas about thirty-nine. His study period ended in 1999, but if one looks \\nat Nobel Prize winners in physics since then, one finds a noticeably \\nolder group. Their average age at the time of their achievement was \\nabout forty-one, and in this discipline where Nobelist Paul Dirac thought \\na person was \"better dead than living still\" after age twenty-nine, we \\nfind among the twenty-two winners from 2000 through 2007 some who \\nmade their mark at ages fifty-eight, sixty-one, and sixty-five. \\nOur insight into how it\\'s possible to maintain top-level performance \\ninto the later decades of life helps us understand those cases in which \\nit doesn\\'t happen. Most people stop the deliberate practice necessary \\nto sustain their performance. We can\\'t necessarily criticize them. It \\nmay be a completely rational decision, for example in the case of a pro \\nathlete who has earned millions of dollars and has little to gain but \\nmuch to lose, in the possibility of serious injury, by continuing to play. \\n184  Great Performance in Youth and Age \\nBusinesspeople who get rich early may see no further reason to keep \\nchallenging themselves. \\nMore broadly, every high performer is continually making a cost-\\nbenefit analysis when it comes to deliberate practice, and as the years \\ngo by, the costs increase while the benefits diminish. Improving per-\\nformance becomes more difficult, and the performer focuses more on \\njust maintaining a given level; as even that become unrealistic, the per-\\nformer seeks ways to compensate for the encroaching weaknesses. The \\nhours required for all this remain punishing, and it\\'s easy to understand \\nhow elite performers may come to feel the effort is no longer worth \\nwhat it produces. The key concept, however, is that for many years in \\na person\\'s life—more years than most of us believe—performance de-\\nterioration in our chosen field isn\\'t an inexorable process. It is, rather, \\na choice about how much effort we want to invest in our performance. \\nAs Karl Malone, the NBA\\'s second all-time top scorer, told the Los An-\\ngeles Times about aging athletes, \"It\\'s not that their bodies stop, it\\'s just \\nthat they\\'ve decided to stop pushing it.\" \\nEventually, of course, everyone\\'s performance declines. Even the \\nmost diligent deliberate practice cannot fend off the advancing years \\nforever. When Arthur Rubinstein gave up performing publicly at eighty-\\nnine, it was because he was becoming blind and deaf. He couldn\\'t prac-\\ntice his way past that. And then there\\'s the ultimate slowing down, \\nwhich even the greatest performers must confront. Warren Buffett told \\nhis shareholders in his 2008 letter, \"I\\'ve reluctantly discarded the notion \\nof my continuing to manage the portfolio after my death—abandoning \\nmy hope to give new meaning to the term \\'thinking outside the box.\" \\nThe perspectives of both youth and age raise a profound question \\nabout great performance, one we\\'ve touched on before but now must \\nface directly. If it\\'s all about the punishing demands of deliberate \\npractice, the continual, painful pushing beyond what\\'s comfortable, for \\nhours a day and years on end, then why does anyone do it? A parent \\n185  Talent Is Overrated \\ncan make a child practice, but not with the focus and intensity needed \\nto become great. Something else must make the child do that. At life\\'s \\nother extreme, Stanley Drucker doesn\\'t need to work, and he certainly \\ndoesn\\'t need to put in the hours required to remain the top clarinetist \\nin one of the world\\'s greatest orchestras. Warren Buffett doesn\\'t need \\nto work. Why do they push themselves? Why does a chess player study \\nfour or five hours a day when becoming even one of the world\\'s top-\\nranked grand masters does not necessarily bring wealth? Why do some \\nyoung businesspeople push themselves beyond their jobs\\' considerable \\ndaily demands to acquire more knowledge and skills when the payoff \\nis uncertain and may be years away? \\nWe know that great performance comes from deliberate practice, \\nbut deliberate practice is hard. It\\'s so hard that no one can do it without \\nthe benefit of passion, a truly extraordinary drive. So we need to know \\nwhere that originates. \\n186  Chapter Eleven \\nWhere Does the Passion Come From? \\nUnderstanding the deepest question \\nabout great performance \\nConsider what Shizuka Arakawa had been through by the time she \\nwon the gold medal in figure skating at the 2006 Winter Olympics in \\nTurin, Italy. She was twenty-four and had been training as a skater since \\nage five. Winning the gold requires flawless performance of moves that \\nthe rest of us would consider simply impossible; Arakawa\\'s specialty \\nwas something called a layback Ina Bauer—bending backward almost \\ndouble with the feet pointing in opposite directions—leading into a \\nthree-jump combination. Perfecting such moves requires huge quanti-\\nties of practice, and falling down during much of it. For Arakawa it took \\nnineteen years. A study of figure skaters found that sub-elite skaters \\nspent lots of time working on the jumps they could already do, while \\nskaters at the highest levels spent more time on the jumps they couldn\\'t \\ndo, the kind that ultimately win Olympic medals and that involve lots \\nof falling down before they\\'re mastered. \\nFalling down in figure skating means landing on your behind, pro-\\ntected only by a thin costume, on hard, cold ice. A few moments with \\na calculator tell us that by an extremely conservative estimate, Ara-\\nkawa\\'s road to the gold medal involved at least twenty thousand derri-\\nere impacts on an unforgiving surface. But they paid off. The results \\nincluded Olympic glory, national adoration, and the suddenly fashion-\\nable use of \"Ina Bauer\" as a vogue word throughout Japan. \\nArakawa\\'s story is not just impressive in itself but also valuable as a \\n187  Talent Is Overrated \\nmetaphor. Landing on your butt twenty thousand times is where great \\nperformance comes from. That fact raises the question of why anyone \\nwould go through it for a reward that is many years away. This is the \\ndeepest question in the study of exceptional performance. In a sense, \\nit is infinitely deep. It\\'s a question about what people decide to do with \\ntheir lives and what kind of passion drives them. The answer may ex-\\ntend so far into a person\\'s psyche that no one can get all the way there. \\nIt sometimes takes us beyond psychology and into psychiatry. But that \\ndoesn\\'t mean the question is a black hole or that pursuing it is hope-\\nless. On the contrary, many findings provide intriguing hints as to why \\ngreat performers pay the price they must pay. The research also sheds \\nlight on how we can answer the question as it applies to ourselves. \\nTwo Kinds of Drive \\nThe central question about motivation to achieve great performance is \\nwhether it\\'s intrinsic or extrinsic. Do people do it because they feel \\ndriven, or is it possible to induce them to do what it takes? Most of us \\nbelieve the drive must be ultimately intrinsic, because we feel nothing \\ncould make someone endure the pain and sacrifice of deliberate prac-\\ntice for decades unless that person carried his or her own compulsion \\nto do it. Much of the research supports this view. In particular, research \\non motivation in creativity has focused on the question of intrinsic ver-\\nsus extrinsic, and it\\'s helpful and relevant for two reasons: In many \\nfields creativity represents the highest level of excellent performance, \\nwhere people go beyond anything already achieved and make new con-\\ntributions; and creativity, like effective practice in any domain, requires \\nintense focus and concentration, which is the element that\\'s most de-\\nmanding and difficult to sustain. \\nThe consistent finding reported by many researchers examining \\nmany domains is that high creative achievement and intrinsic motiva-\\ntion go together. Creative people are focused on the task (How can I \\n188  Where Does the Passion Come From? \\nsolve this problem?) and not on themselves (What will solving this \\nproblem do for me?). Young people who excel in science and math are \\nmore intrinsically motivated than their lower-performing peers. Scien-\\ntists who make important discoveries are found to be passionately in-\\nvolved in their field. A wide range of creative achievers seem to be \\ndevoted to great questions or problems in their field—scientific, com-\\nmercial, artistic—and feel driven to pursue them for decades. \\nLook at the issue from any perspective and the results seem to be \\nthe same. People who rank high for intrinsic motivation on various \\npsychological tests consistently produce work that is judged more crea-\\ntive in studies. Conversely, people who work in professions demanding \\ncreativity (artists, research scientists) reliably rank higher on tests of \\nintrinsic motivation. \\nThe work of University of Chicago psychologist Mihaly Csikszent-\\nmihalyi suggests one specific mechanism (of many that might exist) \\nthat could link intrinsic motivation with the demands of deliberate \\npractice. His famous work on \"flow\" describes a state in which a person \\nis so totally involved in a task that time slows down, enjoyment is \\nheightened, and the task seems almost effortless. This \"high\" is achieved \\nwhen the challenge just matches the person\\'s skills; if it\\'s too easy the \\nexperience is boring, too hard and it\\'s frustrating. As people master \\ntasks, they must seek greater challenges and match them with higher-\\nlevel skills in order to keep experiencing flow. Csikszentmihalyi has \\nargued that this is exactly what many people in creative pursuits do, a \\nprocess that parallels the deliberate practice routine of continually \\npushing past one\\'s current abilities. \\nThe concept of flow might even help explain one of the particular \\npuzzles of motivation to practice. It\\'s a considerable \"might\" because \\nthe research has not been done. But the theory of deliberate practice \\nkeeps running up against a minor real-world contradiction. In the theory, \\npractice is \"not inherently enjoyable.\" Since it requires constantly \\ntrying to do things one can\\'t quite do, and thus failing repeatedly, that \\n189  Talent Is Overrated \\nmakes sense. But in the research, top-level performers, at least in sports, \\noften report the opposite. In studies of wrestlers, skaters, soccer play-\\ners, field hockey players, and martial artists, practice activities rated \\nfairly high on a scale of enjoyableness. As the tennis champion Monica \\nSeles told the New York Times in 1999, \"I just love to practice and drill \\nand that stuff.\" \\nThese reports contrast sharply with the feelings of Ericsson\\'s violin-\\nists, who rated practice a pretty miserable way to spend their time. It \\nmay well be that athletes enjoy practice because for them it\\'s a social \\nactivity, while for violinists it isn\\'t. But at a deeper level one has to sus-\\npect that practice is somehow meeting an inner need for anyone who \\ncan maintain it at an intense level for years. It seems plausible that the \\nrole of practice in producing the highly enjoyable flow state could be \\npart of it. \\nIt certainly seems plausible as well that something more profound \\ncould also be going on. In some fields, such as science and math, fasci-\\nnation with the available problems seems to drive excellent performers. \\nBenjamin Bloom, in his study of top-ranked young performers in sev-\\neral fields, found this motivation in some of them from their early \\nyears: \"For most of the mathematicians, the joy of discovering a new \\nway of solving a problem was more important than a high test score, \\nreceiving a good grade, or getting the teacher\\'s approval for their work.\" \\nMany studies of scientists have reported a similar finding; they get ex-\\ncited by new problems and find rewards not just in the solution but \\nalso in the process of seeking solutions. \\nIn business, motivation has been the subject of endless research stud-\\nies, books, articles, and consulting assignments. The all-time number 2 \\nbest-selling reprint from the Harvard Business Review is a 1968 article \\non motivation (the number 1 best seller is about time management). \\nBut the great majority of the research has focused on what motivates \\nemployees generally, not on what drives the top performers. Studies on \\n190  Where Does the Passion Come From? \\nthat small subset have uncovered a wide range of driving forces, practi-\\ncally all of which are intrinsic. They may include a need for achieve-\\nment, a need for power over others, even a need to do good in the world. \\nBut the drivers are almost never extrinsic, which makes sense when we \\nobserve the most eminent executives and entrepreneurs; long after \\nthey\\'ve accumulated more money than they could ever use and more \\nfame than anyone could hope for, they keep working and trying to get \\nbetter. It all fits with the big-picture idea that intrinsic drive is by far \\nthe most powerful. \\nYet that can\\'t be the whole story. Intrinsic motivation may dominate \\nthe big picture, but everyone, even the greatest achievers, has responded \\nto extrinsic forces at critical moments. When Watson and Crick were \\nstruggling to find the structure of DNA, they worked almost nonstop \\nbecause they knew they were in a race with other research teams. Al-\\nexander Graham Bell worked similarly on the telephone, knowing he \\nwas in competition with Elisha Gray, whom he beat to the patent office \\nby just hours. Such people are driven by much more than fascination \\nor joy. \\nIn extensive research on what drives creative achievement, Teresa \\nAmabile of the Harvard Business School at first proposed a simple hy-\\npothesis: \"The intrinsically motivated state is conducive to creativity, \\nwhereas the extrinsically motivated state is detrimental.\" It\\'s easy to see \\nwhy she considered extrinsic motivation bad news; many studies \\nshowed exactly that. In one of Amabile\\'s own projects, for example, \\ncollege women were asked to make paper collages. Half the subjects \\nwere told their collages would be judged by graduate art students; the \\nothers were told that researchers were studying their mood and had no \\ninterest in the collages themselves. When the collages were then evalu-\\nated by a panel of artists, those produced by the subjects who expected \\nto be judged were significantly less creative. Other studies showed that \\nvirtually any external attempt to constrain or control the work results \\n191  Talent Is Overrated \\nin less creativity. Just being watched is detrimental. Even being offered \\na reward for doing the work results in less creative output than being \\noffered nothing. \\nAll these results were replicated many times. But other studies, going \\nin other directions, were finding something else. Extrinsic motivators \\nwere of many types, not all of them controlling, and some of them \\nseemed to enhance creativity. Specifically, extrinsic motivators that re-\\ninforce intrinsic motivation could work quite effectively. Like what? \\nRecognition that confirms competence turned out to be effective. While \\nthe mere expectation of being judged tended to reduce creativity, per-\\nsonal feedback could actually enhance creativity if it was the right \\nkind—\"constructive, nonthreatening, and work-focused rather than per-\\nson-focused,\" in Amabile\\'s words. That is, feedback that helped a person \\ndo what he or she felt compelled to do was effective. Even the prospect \\nof direct rewards, normally suffocating to creativity, could be helpful if \\nthey were the right kinds of rewards—those \"that involve more time, \\nfreedom, or resources to pursue exciting ideas.\" These findings prompted \\nAmabile to revise her hypothesis: Intrinsic motivation is still best, and \\nextrinsic motivation that\\'s controlling is still detrimental to creativity, \\nbut extrinsic motivators that reinforce intrinsic drives can be highly \\neffective. \\nWe\\'ve looked closely at motivation in creativity because, as noted, it \\nhas much to teach about the larger issue of what makes people persist \\nthrough the demands of high achievement. Looking more broadly re-\\nveals further evidence that extrinsic motivators can, in certain circum-\\nstances, be helpful. For example, large parts of what we call creative \\nwork aren\\'t very creative. Once a problem has been identified and \\nsolved—the creative part—it\\'s necessary to evaluate the solution, write \\naccounts of what was done, and communicate with others about it. All \\nthose jobs can be hard slogging, and the types of extrinsic motivators \\ndescribed above can be helpful in moving the work along. \\nMore fundamentally, learning the skills of a particular field, one of \\n192  Where Does the Passion Come From? \\nthe main objectives of deliberate practice, sometimes benefits from ex-\\ntrinsic motivators, especially in the early stages. Even the elite perform-\\ners studied by Bloom required plenty of extrinsic motivation when they \\nwere starting out in their field. Their parents made them practice, as \\nparents have always done, though it\\'s interesting to note that in these \\ncases, when push came to shove and parents had to make a direct threat, \\nit frequently played off the student\\'s intrinsic motivators. So it wasn\\'t \\n\"If you don\\'t do your piano practice we\\'ll cancel your allowance,\" but \\nrather \"we\\'ll sell the piano.\" Not \"If you don\\'t go to swimming practice \\nyou\\'ll be grounded Saturday night,\" but rather \"we\\'ll take you off the \\nteam.\" If the child truly didn\\'t care about the piano or swimming, the \\nthreats wouldn\\'t have worked. \\nOther extrinsic motivators were also important, and while their ef-\\nfect was to help kids persevere through the challenges of deliberate \\npractice, they were entirely consistent with the effective extrinsic mo-\\ntivators specified by Amabile for creativity. Feedback from coaches and \\nteachers focused on the task and doing it better. Several teachers kept \\ntrack of the child\\'s performance, giving evidence to the child that he or \\nshe was making progress and could keep making progress. Recitals and \\ncontests were motivating because winning or doing well resulted in \\npraise. Attention and acclaim, as a result of performing well, were sig-\\nnificant motivators. \\nWith time, however, \"the students increasingly became responsible \\nfor their own motivation,\" Bloom reports. They set their own goals. Ex-\\ntrinsic motivators still played a role; students wanted to do well in pub-\\nlic performances or competitions. But in part that was because doing \\nso confirmed that they were making progress toward their goals, which \\nis what they really cared about. These events also brought the students \\ntogether with other top-level performers, so each student could figure \\nout \"what he or she must still do to reach the highest level of attainment \\npossible.\" That is, the motivation wasn\\'t just acclaim for performing \\nwell, but, increasingly, the inner drive to be the best. \\n193  Talent Is Overrated \\nHow Organizations Blow It \\nIt must be noted that, on this subject, as with the other findings on great \\nperformance, most organizations seem to be managed brilliantly for \\npreventing people from performing at high levels. Since intrinsic drives \\nare strongest, people will work most passionately and effectively on \\nprojects they choose for themselves. How many companies allow that? \\nA few do, as noted in the previous chapter, and those companies have \\nproduced outstanding results. Yet most other companies steadfastly \\nrefuse to learn from them. Executives may protest that they have a \\nbusiness to manage and can\\'t let employees run around working \\non who-knows-what. Fine; but those executives mustn\\'t complain \\nwhen their company\\'s ideas are no better than the competition\\'s. Nor \\nshould they claim to be mystified when employees lack passion and \\nengagement. \\nHow often is feedback at most companies constructive, nonthreat-\\nening, and work-focused rather than person-focused? Evaluations at \\nmost companies are exactly the opposite: telling the hapless employee \\nwhat he did wrong, not how to do better, and specifying personal traits \\n(attitude, personality) that must be changed, all under the unspoken \\nlooming threat of getting ,  fired. This is so precisely unlike the way ef-\\nfective teachers and coaches help students persist in the demanding \\nwork of getting:better that one can only gaze in wonder. A more potent \\nsystem for discouraging people from the rigors of day-to-day improve-\\nment would be hard to design. As for rewards, at most companies they \\nalmost always entail more responsibilities and less freedom. Extra re-\\nsponsibilities are always part of rising higher in an organization, but if \\nthey don\\'t come with the potential for more self-direction, the promo-\\ntion will feel more like a burden than a reward. Extrinsic motivators \\nmay be, by definition, the only type that a company can offer employ-\\nees, but most companies do it about as poorly as they can. \\n194  Where Does the Passion Come From? \\nThe weight of the evidence is that the drive to persist in the difficult \\njob of improving, especially in adults, comes mostly from inside. Next \\nquestion: How does it arise—that is, where does the passion come \\nfrom? What determines who has it and who doesn\\'t? Some researchers \\nhave argued that at least in some cases it\\'s truly innate, present at birth. \\nEllen Winner, a professor of psychology at Boston College, years ago \\ncoined the wonderful term \"the rage to master\" to describe the over-\\nwhelming drive felt by some children, starting at extremely early ages, \\nto work in a particular field. She has described, for example, the case \\nof Peter, who started drawing at the age of ten months (versus two years \\nfor the average child) and before long \"was waking up in the mornings \\nand bellowing for paper and markers before getting out of bed.\" He \\ndrew obsessively virtually all day every day for years thereafter, and his \\ndrawings were very advanced, far beyond what the average child of his \\nage could produce. \\nThere are precocious children like Peter in many fields in addition \\nto art, including music, chess, and math, and their stories are quite \\namazing. While most children have to be made to practice, these chil-\\ndren can scarcely be restrained from it, and their performance is far \\nbeyond their years. What do these very powerful stories tell us? \\nOne possible explanation is that these kids are somehow born with \\na compulsion to work in a particular domain. In keeping with the prin-\\nciples of great performance, they become very accomplished because \\nthey\\'re practicing for huge numbers of hours. This explanation does \\nnot depend on any miracles, nor does it violate the ten-year rule; while \\nthese kids perform far in advance of other kids their age, they\\'re still \\nnowhere near world-class levels of achievement. That would have to \\nwait much longer. In this theory, exactly why they were born with their \\nspecific compulsion remains a mystery. So far in the decoding of the \\nhuman genome, no one has found a gene that compels a person to draw \\n195  Talent Is Overrated \\ncompulsively, or play the guitar or read or play chess, to name a few \\nother fields in which precocity has turned up. \\nA different explanation, favored by Winner and some other \\nresearchers, is the reverse: Instead of compulsive practice producing \\nhigh ability, high ability leads to compulsive practice. In this explana-\\ntion, these kids are born not with a compulsion to practice but with an \\nability to learn far more quickly than average in a particular domain. \\nThey practice all the time, setting new goals for themselves and increas-\\ning their skill, because their ability to learn makes it so rewarding for \\nthem. This explanation would not seem to cover all cases; it seems ex-\\ntremely unlikely, for example, that Peter was drawing compulsively at \\nten months because of the progress he was making. \\nNote that this explanation is not merely a separate proposal for how \\nthe mechanism of deliberate practice gets set in motion. Winner argues \\nthat these precocious children are not just more diligent but also quali-\\ntatively different from others. Besides their higher ability to learn in \\ntheir field, they also, in the case of artists, are more likely than average \\nto be left-handed or ambidextrous and to be weak at verbal skills. In \\nthis theory, as in the previous one, exactly where the innate factor \\ncomes from—in this case, how a child is born with a superability to \\nlearn in a specific field—remains a mystery. \\nIf neither of these explanations seems totally satisfying, they become \\neven less so when we take a step back and consider the possibility that \\nmaybe the focus isn\\'t quite right in either case. The drive we\\'re looking \\nfor seems to be largely intrinsic, and that fact leads us to wonder what \\ntraits great performers are born with. But maybe that isn\\'t as important \\nas most of us assume it is. Intrinsic doesn\\'t necessarily mean innate, \\nthat is, inborn. The idea that many of our traits and behaviors develop \\nover time as a result of our experiences is noncontroversial, and every-\\none\\'s life is an example. Possibly the intrinsic drive we\\'re seeking also \\ndevelops over time. It\\'s tempting to focus on child prodigies because \\nthey clearly possess some kind of drive from such an early age that it \\n196  Where Does the Passion Come From? \\nseems it must be innate. Perhaps in some of those cases it is, though in \\nsome of them it may not be. Winner cites the case of Yani, a Chinese \\ngirl who by age five was producing paintings in the Chinese tradition \\nthat were strikingly skillful. Yani\\'s father was an artist, and Winner re-\\nports that the young girl \"spent many hours a day in her father\\'s art \\nstudio painting alongside her father.\" Yani was a prodigy for sure, but \\nfrom available evidence it would be hard to conclude that she was \\ndriven by anything truly inborn, either a compulsion to practice or an \\nability to learn, as distinct from the effects of spending all those hours \\nwith her artist father. \\nEven in those cases of child prodigies with proclivities that appear \\nto be innate, studying them doesn\\'t get us very far in understanding \\nthe passion behind great performance. That\\'s because the large major-\\nity of these prodigies, as far as we can tell, don\\'t grow up to be great \\nperformers. A few do, but most don\\'t maintain the intensely focused \\ndaily work for the many years necessary to achieve at the highest levels. \\nWhatever it is they bring into this world, it seems to be a star that \\nshines brilliantly for a time and then usually fades. Josh Waitzkin, the \\nchild prodigy chess player whose story was told in the movie Searching \\nfor Bobby Fischer, suggested an explanation when he once told Psy-\\nchology Today, \"The most gifted kids in chess fall apart. They are told \\nthat they are winners, and when they inevitably run into a wall, they \\nget stuck and think they must be losers.\" \\nConversely, the people who do become top-level achievers are rarely \\nchild prodigies. That is certainly true in business; he early lives of the \\nWelches, Ogilvies, and Rockefellers almost never hint at the success to \\ncome. Looking at more scientific research, this is one of the most nota-\\nble findings in Bloom\\'s large study, which examined performers at the \\nhighest level—people who had achieved national or international rec-\\nognition before age forty. For example, all of the twenty-four pianists \\nstudied—each a finalist in at least one major international competition, \\nsuch as the Van Cliburn or the Levintritt—had had lessons \"forced \\n197  Talent Is Overrated \\nupon them,\" in the words of the study, just the opposite of the kids \\nwho seemed driven to sit at the piano as toddlers. Similarly, in no case \\ndid the parents of the future champion swimmers foresee their child\\'s \\neventual achievements. Time and again the story is the same: Even by \\nage eleven or twelve it would have been difficult to predict who the fu-\\nture exceptional performers would be. \\nEven more important for our purposes, another common theme is \\nthat at some point not long past that age, these future achievers expe-\\nrienced an almost palpable shift in their stance toward their field. Their \\ndrive became intrinsic. One of the pianists recalled the life-changing \\nexperience at age fifteen of sitting just three feet away as a great pianist \\nperformed: \"I remember feeling inundated and overwhelmed with the \\ndynamic range, with the expressive potential, with hearing the real bite \\nof the sound, the real softness of the sound. . . . at that point I became \\nserious like I never had before. I cut out horsing around at the piano. I \\ncut out sightreading for two hours a day just for the pleasure of it. I \\nworked.\" Like all the pianists in the study, he had been forced to,take \\nlessons. It seems safe to say he had not been born with any kind of in-\\nnate drive or rapid learning ability. But at that point he developed the \\nintrinsic drive that would keep him going. \\nThe Multiplier Effect \\nIn our search for the source of the motivation that sustains people \\nthrough the trials of getting better, the evidence is pushing in a clear \\ndirection. The passion doesn\\'t accompany us into this world, but rather, \\nlike high-level skills themselves, it develops. That finding fits well with \\nwhat we observe in real life. World-class achievers are driven to im-\\nprove, but most of them didn\\'t start out that way. We\\'ve already seen \\nthat in domains where it\\'s possible to start work at an early age, such \\nas music and sports, most future great performers need to be pushed \\nat first. In domains where building the knowledge foundation takes \\n198  Where Does the Passion Come From? \\nmany years before specific domain-related work can begin, such as busi-\\nness and high-level science, we commonly see that future stars may be \\ndecidedly undriven even as young adults. That was obviously the case \\nwith Steven Ballmer and Jeffrey Immelt sitting in their cubicle at \\nProcter & Gamble. Both young men went on to business school (Ballmer \\nto Stanford, Immelt to Harvard) and over time developed the drive to \\nwork prodigiously hard, not just in general, but specifically at building \\nthe particular skills that brought them to the top of the corporate world. \\nBoth men became famously focused workers. But they obviously did \\nnot possess that drive from day one. \\nIf the drive to excel develops, rather than appearing fully formed, \\nthen how does it develop? Several researchers have separately proposed \\na mechanism that suggests an answer. Part of its appeal is that it helps \\nexplain why some people but not others develop high-level skills \\nand at the same time develop the increasing motivation needed to \\ndo ever more advanced work. Stephen J. Ceci, Susan M. Barnett, and \\nTomoe Kanaya of Cornell University have called it the multiplier \\neffect. \\nThe concept is simple. A very small advantage in some field can \\nspark a series of events that produce far larger advantages. For example, \\nthey say, imagine someone who is just slightly above average in \\neye-hand coordination, forearm strength, and reflexes. Initially, this \\nindividual may take satisfaction in doing slightly better at baseball \\nthan his schoolyard peers.. .. This satisfaction may lead such an in-\\ndividual to practice more, search more aggressively for others willing \\nto play after school and on weekends, try out for teams (not just \\nschool teams but also summer league teams), get professional coach-\\ning, watch and discuss televised games, and so forth. Such an in-\\ndividual is likely to become matched with increasingly enriched \\nenvironments for baseball skills. . . . Factors cascade over  time be-\\ncause they multiply the effects of earlier, seemingly weak, factors. \\n199  Talent Is Overrated \\nIt\\'s easy to imagine the same process playing out in any other domain. \\nAs these researchers describe the general effect, \"Each increase in \\ncompetence is matched to a better environment, and, in turn, the better \\nenvironment will be expected to further enhance their competence.\" \\nNote that this multiplier effect accounts not just for improvement \\nof skills over time but also for the motivation that drives the improve-\\nment, as the young baseball player\\'s satisfaction leads him to practice \\nmore. The sequence proposed by these researchers is strikingly similar \\nto the actual experiences of future achievers reported in Bloom\\'s re-\\nsearch. He observed, \"In all the fields most of these young students were \\nregarded as fast learners by their first teachers.... Whether or not they \\nwere really faster learners than others is not known. . . . However, the \\nattribution of \\'fast learner\\' to them by the initial teacher was one major \\nsource of motivation. The teacher soon regarded and treated them as \\n`special\\' learners, and the students came to prize this very much.\" \\nBefore long, the multiplier effect was clearly developing the drive of \\nthese students: \"As they began to receive recognition for the talent in \\nthe early years of instruction, the children\\'s investment in the talent \\nbecame greater. No longer was the prime motivation to please parents \\nand teachers. It now became the individual\\'s special field of interest.\" \\nThe concept of the multiplier effect is embedded in the fundamental \\ntheory of deliberate practice. Part of the way it works, as first explained \\nby Anders Ericsson and his colleagues, is that a beginner\\'s skills are so \\nmodest that he or she can manage only a little bit of deliberate practice, \\nsince it\\'s highly demanding. But that little bit of practice increases the \\nperson\\'s skills, making it possible to do more practice, which increases \\nthe person\\'s skill level more. Thus, \"In our framework we expect that \\nincreased level of acquired skill and performance would increase the \\nmaximal level of deliberate practice that can be sustained.\" The theory \\nfits the evidence reported by others. In virtually every field, beginners \\ncan\\'t manage more than an hour of practice per day, and sometimes \\nmuch less. But by the time they become top performers, they\\'ve built \\n200  Where Does the Passion Come From? \\nthemselves up to handling four to five hours a day. It isn\\'t quite right \\nto say only that the practice caused the performance or that the perfor-\\nmance helped support the practice. Over time, each contributed to the \\nother. \\nThe evidence for the multiplier effect is powerful, in addition to \\nwhich it makes sense and explains quite a bit. It then raises a very large \\nquestion: What triggers the effect? If it all begins with some small \\nadvantage—a little difference that somehow tips a balance and starts \\na self-fueling cycle of increasing motivation and performance—where \\ndoes that difference originate? \\nCeci and his colleagues, in first describing the effect, assumed the \\ndifference was genetic; the reason that kid had better than average eye-\\nhand coordination and other traits that gave him a small advantage in \\nbaseball is that he was born with them. Obviously this possibility can-\\nnot be denied, especially with regard to body traits that are heavily in-\\nfluenced by genes. In addition, it\\'s easy to imagine how intelligence and \\nother traits with a genetic component might trigger a multiplier effect, \\neven if the significance of the genetic component is in dispute. After \\nall, a small advantage is all it takes. We saw in chapter 3 that intelligence \\nand other general abilities play a much smaller role in top-level perfor-\\nmance than most of us believe, but even if intelligence isn\\'t the critical \\nperformance factor in many fields, a small intelligence advantage at an \\nearly age could still trigger a multiplier effect that would produce ex-\\nceptional performance many years later. Clearly these traits would not \\nbe guaranteed to set off multiplier effects in every case. If the kid with \\nthe baseball advantage lived in a time or place where baseball was un-\\nheard of, he\\'d be out of luck, and we can easily imagine endless other \\nscenarios in which some trait that could conceivably trigger a multiplier \\neffect in one setting would produce no effect in another. \\nThe much more intriguing possibility is that events or situations \\nhaving nothing to do with innate traits could also set off multiplier \\neffects. An example that seems to occur quite often is what happens \\n201  Talent Is Overrated \\nwhen someone begins training at an earlier age than others in the field. \\nMany researchers have observed that as people start learning skills in \\nvirtually any field, they\\'re typically compared not against the world\\'s \\ngreatest performers in that field but against others their own age. No-\\nbody considered whether the ten-year-old Tiger Woods was a threat to \\nthe top professionals; what mattered was that he was much better than \\nother ten-year-olds. One way to get a very good shot at performing bet-\\nter than others of the same age is to start training earlier than they do \\n(as Woods did), thus accumulating more deliberate practice. Standing \\nout at any given age is an excellent way to attract attention and praise, \\nfueling the multiplier, and it can be done without relying on any innate \\nability. It\\'s worth noting that studies of swimmers, gymnasts, chess \\nplayers, violinists, and pianists show that the more accomplished per-\\nformers started training at earlier ages. \\nA similar way to ignite the multiplier effect is to begin learning skills \\nin a place where competition is sparse. It\\'s a lot easier to stand out as a \\nmath whiz when your town has only a hundred other kids your age \\nthan when it has a hundred thousand. Many of the young achievers in \\nBloom\\'s study reported the same experience: being local celebrities, \\nonly to move on to a higher level of competition and find that plenty \\nof others are at least as good as they are. As one of the pianists recalled \\nabout his arrival at an elite music school, \"It was a shock. It\\'s not easy \\nto find out that there are other people who really play very well when \\nyou\\'ve been isolated and made to think you\\'re something.\" But it\\'s okay; \\nby this time, these performers had developed the drive to keep going. \\nWould they have developed that drive in a setting where they received \\nan early message that they were nothing special? Howard Gardner, in \\nhis study of Einstein, Stravinsky, and other exceptional creators, ob-\\nserved that they generally didn\\'t come from major cities. Instead, they \\ndeveloped their skills in smaller environments and then moved on to \\nthe big time. \\nCould the multiplier effect even be triggered in what we might call \\n202  Where Does the Passion Come From? \\nthe opposite way? It seems plausible that mildly superior performance \\nat an early age or in a small milieu, no matter how attained, could at-\\ntract the extra praise that builds motivation for more intense practice, \\nand so on. But since the process is circular, could we start it spinning \\nnot with superior performance but with extra praise? That is, could \\nsimply telling someone that he or she is especially good, regardless of \\nactual performance, motivate the extra practice that leads to improved \\nperformance, attracting more praise, and so on? This also seems plau-\\nsible. Recall that, even though Bloom had no evidence that his research \\nsubjects were fast learners, their teachers saw them that way. He re-\\nported that, in general, \"The teacher soon regarded and treated them \\nas \\'special\\' learners, and the students came to prize this very much.\" \\nIn addition, many of these students had parents who told them they \\nwere special, as parents so often do, regardless of actual evidence. Here \\nagain, it seems possible that a factor quite independent of any innate \\nability could start the multiplier effect turning, or at least give it a good \\nshove. \\nIt seems possible, and even likely based on available evidence—but \\nit isn\\'t proven. The rigorous research that would nail down this possi-\\nbility hasn\\'t been done. It could be and perhaps will be. Stephen Ceci \\nand his colleagues believe \"it is a testable empirical question\" whether \\n\"environmental factors\"—such things as earlier deliberate practice, \\nextra praise, or others—could \"jump start the dynamic multiplier ef-\\nfect.\" But they conclude that so far \"this has not been tested in an em-\\npirically adequate manner.\" So we just don\\'t know for sure. \\nWhat Do You Believe? \\nThat conclusion is highly significant for our purposes because it means \\nthat, research-wise, we\\'ve reached the end of the line. It\\'s the end of the \\nline not just on the question of motivation, but also in a much larger \\nsense. \\n203  Talent Is Overrated \\nOur quest for the source of great performance has taken us past \\nmany wrong turns and through a great deal of useful knowledge, and \\nhas led us finally to the issue of where the drive to persevere comes \\nfrom. We\\'ve learned a lot even about that. Most significant, we\\'ve seen \\nthat the passion develops, rather than emerging suddenly and fully \\nformed. We\\'ve also seen hints that childhood may be especially impor-\\ntant in how the drive\\'s development gets started. Anders Ericsson goes \\nso far as to say, \"The research frontier is parenting. Push children too \\nhard and they respond with anger. You have to develop an independent \\nindividual who has chosen to be involved in this activity. It\\'s how you \\nas a parent can make individuals feel freed to reach these levels and \\naware that this is going to be a long process.\" Yes, maybe that is what \\nit\\'s all about. But as he says, that\\'s the research frontier. The work hasn\\'t \\nbeen done yet. \\nUltimately, we cannot get to the very heart of this matter; we cannot \\nexplain fully and generally why certain people put themselves through \\nthe years or decades of punishing, intensive daily work that eventually \\nmakes them world-class great. We\\'ve reached the point where we are \\nleft without guidance from the scientists and must proceed by looking \\nin the only place we have left, which is within ourselves. \\nWhat would cause you to do the enormous work necessary to be a \\ntop-performing CEO, Wall Street trader, jazz pianist, courtroom lawyer, \\nor anything else? Would anything? The answers depend on your an-\\nswers to two basic questions: What do you really want? And what do \\nyou really believe? \\nWhat you want—really, deeply want—is fundamental because de-\\nliberate practice is a heavy investment. Becoming a great performer \\ndemands the largest investment you will ever make—many years of \\nyour life devoted utterly to your goal—and only someone who wants \\nto reach that goal with extraordinary power can make it. We often see \\nthe price people pay in their rise to the top of any field; even if their \\nmarriages or other relationships survive, their interests outside their \\n204  Where Does the Passion Come From? \\nfield typically cannot. Howard Gardner, after studying his seven excep-\\ntional achievers, noted that \"usually, as a means of being able to con-\\ntinue work, the creator sacrificed normal relationships in the personal \\nsphere.\" Such people are \"committed obsessively to their work. Social \\nlife or hobbies are almost immaterial.\" That may sound like admirable \\nself-sacrifice and direction of purpose, but it often goes much further, \\nand it can be ugly. As Gardner notes, \"the self-confidence merges with \\negotism, egocentrism, and narcissism: each of the creators seems highly \\nself-absorbed, not only wholly involved in his or her own projects, \\nbut likely to pursue them at the cost of other individuals.\" The story \\nof the great achiever who leaves a wake of anger and betrayal is a \\ncommon one. \\nSo what would it take for you to accept all of that in pursuit of a \\ngoal? What would you want so much that you\\'d commit yourself to the \\nnecessary hard, endless work, giving up relationships and other inter-\\nests, so that you might eventually get it? Whatever it is that the greatest \\nperformers want, that\\'s how much they must want it. \\nThe second question is more profound. What do you really believe? \\nDo you believe that you have a choice in this matter? Do you be-\\nlieve that if you do the work, properly designed, with intense focus for \\nhours a day and years on end, your performance will grow dramati-\\ncally better and eventually reach the highest levels? If you believe that, \\nthen there\\'s at least a chance you will do the work and achieve great \\nperformance. \\nBut if you believe that your performance is forever limited by your \\nlack of a specific innate gift, or by a lack of general abilities at a level \\nthat you think must be necessary, then there\\'s no chance at all that you \\nwill do the work. \\nThat\\'s why this belief is tragically constraining. Everyone who has \\nachieved exceptional performance has encountered terrible difficulties \\nalong the way. There are no exceptions. If you believe that doing the \\nright kind of work can overcome the problems, then you have at least \\n205  Talent Is Overrated \\na chance of moving on to ever better performance. But those who see \\nthe setbacks as evidence that they lack the necessary gift will give up—\\nquite logically, in light of their beliefs. They will never achieve what \\nthey might have. \\nWhat you really believe about the source of great performance thus \\nbecomes the foundation of all you will ever achieve. As we noted much \\nearlier, such beliefs can be extremely deep-seated. Regardless of where \\nour beliefs in this matter originated, however, we all have the opportu-\\nnity to base them on the evidence of reality. \\nThe evidence offers no easy assurances. It shows that the price of \\ntop-level achievement is extraordinarily high. Perhaps it\\'s inevitable \\nthat not many people will choose to pay it. But the evidence shows also \\nthat by understanding how a few become great, anyone can become \\nbetter. Above all, what the evidence shouts most loudly is striking, lib-\\nerating news: that great performance is not reserved for a preordained \\nfew. It is available to you and to everyone. \\n206  Acknowledgments \\nThis book would not have been written if my Fortune colleague Jerry \\nUseem hadn\\'t walked into my office and asked if I wanted to write \\nsomething for a special issue on great performance in business. It \\nturned out I\\'d been waiting a long time for that question. I held strong \\nviews and had considerable curiosity about the topic, far more than I \\nrealized. \\nThe resulting article provoked a more intense response than any-\\nthing else I\\'ve written. It was certainly e-mailed a lot, but beyond that, \\nit seemed to reach readers in a deeper way. Several people told me they \\nhad read it aloud to their kids, which is not a reaction we often get to \\nan article in a business magazine. People thanked me for writing it, \\neven many months after it appeared. I suspected there was more to be \\nsaid. \\nSo thank you, Jerry, and thank you to Hank Gilman, Eric Pooley, and \\nthe other Fortune editors who helped bring the article to publication. \\nProfessor K. Anders Ericsson, Conradi Eminent Scholar at Florida \\nState University, whom we met several times in this book, was ex-\\ntremely generous with his time and thoughts. As I hope is clear, his \\nwork over the past thirty years, on his own and with colleagues, formed \\nthe foundation of many of the ideas presented here. He deserves \\nspecial thanks because this book could not have been written with-\\nout him. \\nAdrian Zackheim, Adrienne Schultz, and the team at Penguin Group \\n(USA) were encouraging and supportive at every turn, which makes a \\ndifference to an author. \\n207  Acknowledgments \\nBob Barnett and Dineen Howell of Williams & Connolly represented \\nme superbly, as always. \\nMost of all I must thank my family for their understanding and sup-\\nport during a project that I should have known would be more work \\nthan I thought. \\n208  Sources \\nChapter One: The Mystery \\nFor research on how some types of auditor skills diminish over time, see \\nJean Bedard, Michelene T.

It is in J. Doll and U. Mayr, \"Intelligence and Achievement in \\nChess—A Study of Chess Masters,\" Psychologische Beitrage 29 (1987), pp. \\n270-89. \\nThe research on chess players and how well they can recall the positions \\nof pieces on the board has proven to be extremely important in the study \\nof great performance because it reveals that the seemingly incredible mem-\\nories of chess experts are developed and specific to chess, not innate and \\ngeneral. Three researchers built the foundation of this work. One was a \\nDutch researcher, A. D. de Groot, whose doctoral dissertation was written \\nin 1946 but not translated into English until 1965. The other two are \\nWilliam Chase and Herbert Simon, whose research showed that chess ex-\\nperts could remember the positions of many pieces in actual chess posi-\\ntions but were scarcely better than novices at remembering the positions \\nof pieces placed randomly. See A. D. de Groot, Thought and Choice in \\nChess (The Hague: Mouton, 1946/1965); W. G. Chase and H. A. Simon, \\n\"Perception in Chess,\" Cognitive Psychology 4 (1973), pp. 55-81; and \\nW. G.

The standard description is in P. Fitts and M. I. Pos-\\nner, Human Performance (Belmont, Calif.: Brooks/Cole, 1967). \\nThe opposite view, that top performers reach their high levels of achieve-\\nment in part by avoiding automaticity, is described in K.
